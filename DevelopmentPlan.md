Below is a comprehensive, high-level plan for developing NormHelper, a Q/A chat interface connected to the DocBots API, with a target deployment on Netlify. This plan is structured in discrete phases, each containing specific tasks and key considerations. It is deliberately detailed to guide an AI coding agent (or any developer) through the end-to-end development process.

1. Project Setup
Decide on Tech Stack

Frontend: A lightweight HTML/CSS/JavaScript or a React/Vue single-page application (SPA).
Backend / Serverless Functions: Netlify Functions (AWS Lambda under the hood) to securely handle DocBots API calls.
Package Manager: npm or yarn.
Version Control: GitHub or GitLab for code storage.
Initialize the Project

Create a new repository.
Set up a base project structure (e.g., React + Vite or Create React App, or a simple static site with JS).
Configure linting (ESLint/Prettier) if desired.
Install Dependencies (depending on the chosen frontend framework)

For React: npm install react react-dom (or use a starter like Create React App / Vite).
For Netlify Functions: no specific library needed initially unless you plan to use something like node-fetch or axios to make server-side calls.
Environment Variables

Generate a DocBots API key in the DocBots dashboard.
Add a secure environment variable in Netlify (e.g., DOCBOTS_API_KEY) so it is never exposed client-side.
2. Bot Configuration and Documentation Familiarity
Identify Your Team and Bot IDs

In DocBots, retrieve your teamId and botId.
Note these IDs for making calls to the relevant endpoints (e.g., /teams/[teamId]/bots/[botId]/chat).
Determine Chat Interface Requirements

Q/A vs Full Chat: NormHelper will support basic Q/A plus conversation memory.
Non-Streaming or Streaming: Decide if you want the user to see partial, “streamed” responses. For a simple Q/A interface, the REST approach might be simpler.
Review DocBots Documentation

Understand the parameters needed for each endpoint (question, history, full_source, etc.).
Familiarize yourself with authentication requirements (Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY> for REST, auth field in JSON for WebSockets streaming).
Note error handling for typical 4xx/5xx codes.
3. UI & UX Planning
Wireframe the NormHelper Interface

Input Textbox: For a question, with a “Send” button.
Chat Log: To display the conversation (question-answer pairs).
Sources (Optional): Collapsible or inline display of sources.
Rating/Feedback (Optional): Optionally, allow user to mark an answer as helpful or not (DocBots offers rating endpoints).
Decide on Look and Feel

Minimalist design: Single column with chat bubbles.
Color palette and branding for “NormHelper”.
User Interaction Flow

User types question, clicks send → Show loading indicator → Display bot response.
Append conversation to a chat log. If continuing the conversation, incorporate the returned history array in the subsequent requests.
4. Implementation Architecture
Below is a suggested architecture, which keeps your API key secure on Netlify:

Client-Side

/public or /src: Contains the main UI (HTML/CSS/JS or React components).
Requests to Netlify Function: The front-end calls a local endpoint (e.g., /.netlify/functions/ask).
Netlify Function (ask.js or ask.ts)

Receives the user question and optional chat history from the client.
Injects the server-side DOCBOTS_API_KEY (via environment variable).
Forwards the request to DocBots REST API endpoint: POST https://api.docsbot.ai/teams/[teamId]/bots/[botId]/chat.
Returns the response JSON to the front-end.
Security Considerations

Do not expose the API key in front-end code.
If using streaming, either keep the logic server-side or carefully manage WebSocket connections via a serverless approach (though Netlify Functions may not support persistent websockets natively—one might need a different approach or stick to REST for simplicity).
5. Step-by-Step Development Tasks
5.1 Create the Netlify Function
File Structure

bash
Copy code
root
├── netlify.toml
├── package.json
├── src
│    └── ...
└── netlify
     └── functions
          └── ask.js
In ask.js:

Read the environment variable for DOCBOTS_API_KEY.
Extract the question and history from the request body.
Construct the POST request to DocBots’ Q/A endpoint.
Return the response to the caller.
js
Copy code
// netlify/functions/ask.js
import fetch from 'node-fetch';

export const handler = async (event) => {
  try {
    const { question, history } = JSON.parse(event.body);
    const apiKey = process.env.DOCBOTS_API_KEY;
    const teamId = process.env.DOCBOTS_TEAM_ID; 
    const botId = process.env.DOCBOTS_BOT_ID;

    const apiUrl = `https://api.docsbot.ai/teams/${teamId}/bots/${botId}/chat`;

    const requestOptions = {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        Authorization: `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        question,
        history,
        full_source: false,
      }),
    };

    const response = await fetch(apiUrl, requestOptions);
    const data = await response.json();

    return {
      statusCode: 200,
      body: JSON.stringify(data),
    };
  } catch (error) {
    return {
      statusCode: 500,
      body: JSON.stringify({ message: 'Server error', error: error.toString() }),
    };
  }
};
Environment Variables

Set DOCBOTS_API_KEY, DOCBOTS_TEAM_ID, and DOCBOTS_BOT_ID in Netlify Build settings (Project Settings → Build & Deploy → Environment).
Never commit the actual API key to source control.
Local Testing

Use netlify dev to run the function locally.
Send test requests with curl or Postman to http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/ask.
5.2 Front-End (React Example)
Create UI

A simple component with a text input (<input type="text" />) and a send button.
A display area showing question/answer pairs.
jsx
Copy code
// src/App.jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function App() {
  const [question, setQuestion] = useState('');
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);

  const sendQuestion = async () => {
    if (!question.trim()) return;
    // Add user question to chat
    const newMessages = [...messages, { sender: 'user', text: question }];
    setMessages(newMessages);

    try {
      const response = await fetch('/.netlify/functions/ask', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify({
          question,
          // Extract the relevant "history" from newMessages
          history: transformMessagesToHistory(newMessages),
        }),
      });
      const data = await response.json();
      // data.answer is the bot response, data.history is the updated history, etc.
      setMessages([...newMessages, { sender: 'bot', text: data.answer }]);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
      setMessages([...newMessages, { sender: 'bot', text: 'Error retrieving answer.' }]);
    }
    setQuestion('');
  };

  return (
    <div className="container">
      <div className="chat-container">
        {messages.map((msg, index) => (
          <div key={index} className={`chat-bubble ${msg.sender}`}>
            <p>{msg.text}</p>
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>
      <div className="input-container">
        <input
          value={question}
          onChange={(e) => setQuestion(e.target.value)}
          placeholder="Ask NormHelper..."
        />
        <button onClick={sendQuestion}>Send</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

function transformMessagesToHistory(messages) {
  // For each user-bot pair, structure it like [question, answer]
  // The simplest approach is to find pairs. The last user message doesn't have a bot response until after the fetch.
  const history = [];
  let pair = [];
  messages.forEach((msg) => {
    if (msg.sender === 'user') {
      pair = [msg.text]; // start new pair
    } else if (msg.sender === 'bot' && pair.length === 1) {
      pair.push(msg.text);
      history.push([...pair]);
      pair = [];
    }
  });
  return history;
}

export default App;
Styling

Minimal CSS for .chat-bubble.user vs .chat-bubble.bot.
Responsive design so it works on mobile.
Handling Sources

If you want to display sources from data.sources, store them in state. Possibly show them in a collapsible panel beneath each answer.
5.3 Additional Features (Optional)
Answer Rating

Integrate the DocBots Answer Rating API to record user feedback.
On the final answer, present thumbs-up/down. Send PUT request to the rate endpoint with answerId.
Error Handling & Alerts

Provide user-friendly error messages (e.g., “Sorry, something went wrong.”) on status codes 4xx/5xx.
Streaming

If you want real-time streaming of answers, adopt the DocBots WebSocket approach. However, implementing websockets on Netlify typically requires additional setup or a different hosting environment (e.g., Heroku or a specialized WS proxy). For a very simple Q/A interface, REST is easiest.
Agent API

If you need advanced features (multiple agent tools, image-based queries, stateful conversation without storing history locally), consider the Chat Agent API (BETA). You’ll need to handle conversation IDs and possibly SSE. This can add complexity.
6. Testing and Validation
Unit Tests

Test the Netlify function with sample payloads. Verify correct responses and error handling.
Optionally, implement Jest or Mocha for front-end interaction tests.
Integration Tests

Manually test the full flow in the dev environment:
Ask question, see answer, confirm correctness.
Ask follow-up question, confirm conversation continuity.
Validate any rating/feedback flows.
Performance & Edge Cases

Check load times and response times.
Test short questions, long questions near the 2000-char limit.
Test concurrency (if multiple users open NormHelper simultaneously).
7. Deploying to Netlify
Configure Netlify Project

Log into Netlify, create a new site from your Git repo.
Ensure environment variables (DOCBOTS_API_KEY, etc.) are set in Netlify’s dashboard.
Build Command & Publish Directory

For a simple React site, the build command might be npm run build and the publish directory build.
Netlify automatically detects and deploys serverless functions in netlify/functions.
Deployment Verification

Once deployed, open your Netlify app URL and test the chat interface end-to-end.
Production Monitoring

Check Netlify logs for function errors.
Possibly enable Netlify Analytics or a custom solution for usage stats.
8. Maintenance & Ongoing Improvements
Analytics / Logging

Implement analytics to track user questions, answers, and usage.
Watch for unhandled errors, timeouts, or unexpected 4xx/5xx from DocBots.
Further Bot Tuning

In DocBots, refine your sources, possibly enable classify or advanced settings to improve Q/A accuracy.
Periodically re-index content if you add new docs to the knowledge base.
User Feedback & Iteration

Gather feedback on whether the answers are accurate, relevant, or helpful.
Adjust the prompt, system instructions, or doc sources as needed.
Security Updates

Rotate API keys if compromised.
Monitor Netlify roles/settings to ensure read-only or restricted access where appropriate.
Conclusion
By following this plan, you’ll have a simple, secure, and functional Q/A chat tool named NormHelper that connects to the DocBots API. The critical points are to keep your API key out of the front-end, use Netlify Functions to mediate requests, and structure the chat so it can handle a user’s ongoing conversation (via history). With these steps in mind, your AI coding agent (or development team) should be set for a smooth build and successful deployment of NormHelper on Netlify.
