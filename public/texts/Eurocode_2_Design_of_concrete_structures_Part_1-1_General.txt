This European Standard EN 1992, Eurocode 2: Design of concrete structures: General rules 
and rules for buildings, has been prepared by Technical Conlrnittee CEN/TC250 ¬´ Structural 
Eurocodes ¬ª, the Secretariat of which is held by BSI. CEN/TC250 is responsible for all 
Structural Eurocodes. 
This European Standard shall be given the status of a National Standard, either by publication 
of an identical text or by endorsement, at the latest by June 2005, and conflicting National 
Standards shall be withdrawn at latest by March 2010. 
This Eurocode supersedes ENV 1992-1-1,1992-1-3,1992-1-4,1992-1-5,1992-1-6 and 1992-3. 
According to the CEN-CENELEC Internal Regulations, the National Standard Organisations of 
the following countries are bound to implement these European Standard: Austria, Belgium, 
Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary,

Background to the Eurocode programme 
In 1975, the Comnlission of the European Community decided on an action programme in the 
field of construction, based on article 95 of the Treaty. The objective of the programme was the 
elimination of technical obstacles to trade and the harmonisation of technical specifications. 
Within this action programme, the Commission took the initiative to establish a set of 
harmonised technical rules for the design of construction works which, in a first stage, would 
serve as an alternative to the national rules in force in the Member States and, ultimately, would 
replace them. 
For fifteen years, the Commission, with the help of a Steering Comnlittee with Representatives 
of Member States, conducted the development of the Eurocodes programme, which led to the 
first generation of European codes in the 1980s. 
In 1989, the Commission and the Member States of the EU and EFTA decided, on the basis of 
an agreement1 between the Commission and CEN, to transfer the preparation and the 
publication of the Eurocodes to CEN through a series of Mandates, in order to provide them 
with a future status of European Standard (EN). This links de facto the Eurocodes with the 
provisions of all the Council's Directives and/or Commission's Decisions dealing with European 
standards (e.g. the Council Directive 89/106/EEC on construction products -CPD -and Council 
Directives 93/37/EEC, 92/50/EEC and 89/440/EEC on public works and services and equivalent 
EFTA Directives initiated in pursuit of setting up the internal market). 
The Structural Eurocode programme comprises the following standards generally consisting of 
a number of Parts: 
EN 1990 Eurocode 0: Basis of Structural Design 
EN 1991 Eurocode 1: Actions on structures 
EN 1992 Eurocode 2: Design of concrete structures 
EN 1993 Eurocode 3: Design of steel structures 
EN 1994 Eurocode 4: Design of composite steel and concrete structures 
EN 1995 Eurocode 5: Design of timber structures 
EN 1996 Eurocode 6: Design of masonry structures 
EN 1997 Eurocode 7: Geotechnical design 
EN 1998 Eurocode 8: Design of structures for earthquake resistance 
EN 1999 Eurocode 9: Design of aluminium structures 
Eurocode standards recognise the responsibility of regulatory authorities in each Member State 
and have safeguarded their right to determine values related to regulatory safety matters at 
national level where these continue to vary from State to State. 
Status and field of application of eurocodes 
The Member States of the EU and EFTA recognise that Eurocodes serve as reference 
documents for the following purposes: 
as a means to prove compliance of building and civil engineering works with the essential 
Agreement between the Commission of the European Communities and the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) concerning the work 
on EUROCODES for the design of building and civil engineering works (BC/CEN/03/89).

requirements of Council Directive 89/106/EEC, particularly Essential Requirement N¬∞1 -
Mechanical resistance and stability -and Essential Requirement N¬∞2 -Safety in case of fire; 
as a basis for specifying contracts for construction works and related engineering services; 
as a framework for drawing up harmonised technical specifications for construction products 
(ENs and ETAs) 
The Eurocodes, as far as they concern the construction works themselves, have a direct 
relationship with the Interpretative Documents2 referred to in Article 12 of the CPO, although 
they are of a different nature from harmonised product standards3. Therefore, technical aspects 
arising from the Eurocodes work need to be adequately considered by CEN Technical 
Committees and/or EOTA Working Groups working on product standards with a view to 
achieving full compatibility of these technical specifications with the Eurocodes. 
The Eurocode standards provide common structural design rules for everyday use for the 
design of whole structures and conlponent products of both a traditional and an innovative 
nature. Unusual forms of construction or design conditions are not specifically covered and 
additional expert consideration will be required by the designer in such cases.

The National Standards implementing Eurocodes will comprise the full text of the Eurocode 
(including any annexes), as published by CEN, which may be preceded by a National title page 
and National foreword, and may be followed by a National annex. 
The National annex may only contain information on those parameters which are left open in 
the Eurocode for national choice, known as Nationally Determined Parameters, to be used for 
the design of buildings and civil engineering works to be constructed in the country concerned, 
i.e. : 
values and/or classes where alternatives are given in the Eurocode, 
values to be used where a symbol only is given in the Eurocode, 
country specific data (geographical, climatic, etc.), e.g. snow map, 
the procedure to be used where alternative procedures are given in the Eurocode. 
It may contain 
decisions on the application of informative annexes, 
-references to non-contradictory complementary information to assist the user to apply the 
Eurocode. 
Links between Eurocodes and harmonised technical specifications (ENs and ETAs) for 
products 
There is a need for consistency between the harmonised technical specifications for 
2 According to Art. 3.3 of the CPO, the essential requirements (ERs) shall be given concrete form in interpretative documents for the creation of the 
3 necessary links between the essential requirements and the mandates for harmonised ENs and ETAGs/ETAs. 
According to Art. 12 of the CPD the interpretative documents shall: 
a) give concrete form to the essential requirements by harmonising the terminology and the technical bases and indicating classes or levels for 
each requirement where necessary ; 
b) indicate methods of correlating these classes or levels of requirement with the technical specifications, e.g. methods of calculation and of 
proof, technical rules for project design, etc. ; 
c) serve as a reference for the establishment of harmonised standards and guidelines for European technical approvals. 
The Eurocodes, de facto, playa similar role in the field of the ER 1 and a part of ER 2.

construction products and the technical rules for works4. Furthermore, all the information 
accompanying the CE Marking of the construction products which refer to Eurocodes should 
clearly mention which Nationally Determined Parameters have been taken into account. 
Additional information specific to EN 1992-1-1 
EN 1992-1-1 describes the principles and requirements for safety, serviceability and durability 
of concrete structures, together with specific provisions for buildings. It is based on the limit 
state concept used in conjunction with a partial factor method. 
For the design of new structures, EN 1992-1-1 is intended to be used, for direct application, 
together with other parts of EN 1992, Eurocodes EN 1990,1991, 1997 and 1998. 
EN 1992-1-1 also serves as a reference document for other CEN TCs concerning structural 
matters. 
EN 1992-1-1 is intended for use by: 
committees drafting other standards for structural design and related product, testing and 
execution standards; 
-clients (e.g. for the formulation of their specific requirements on reliability levels and durability); 
designers and constructors; 
-relevant authorities. 
Numerical values for partial factors and other reliability parameters are recommended as basic 
values that provide an acceptable level of reliability. They have been selected assuming that an 
appropriate level of workmanship and of quality management applies. When EN 1992-1-1 is 
used as a base document by other CENITCs the same values need to be taken. 
National annex for EN 1992-1-1 
This standard gives values with notes indicating where national choices may have to be made. 
Therefore the National Standard implementing EN 1992-1-1 should have a National annex 
containing all Nationally Determined Parameters to be used for the design of buildings and civil 
engineering works to be constructed in the relevant country. 
National choice is allowed in EN 1992-1-1 through the following clauses: 
4 see Art.3.3 and Art.12 of the CPD, as well as clauses 4.2, 4.3.1,4.3.2 and 5.2 of ID 1.

=== PAGE 18 ===

BS EN 1992-1-1:2004 
EN 1992-1-1:2004 (E) 
-Adequate supervision and quality control is provided in factories, in plants, and on site. 
-Construction is carried out by personnel having the appropriate skill and experience. 
-The construction materials and products are used as specified in this Eurocode or in the 
relevant material or product specifications.

The requirements for execution and workmanship given in ENV 13670 are complied with. 
1.4 Distinction between principles and application rules 
(1)P The rules given in EN 1990 apply. 
1.5 Definitions 
1.5.1 General 
(1)P The terms and definitions given in EN 1990 apply. 
1.5.2 Additional terms and definitions used in this Standard 
1.5.2.1 Precast structures. Precast structures are characterised by structural elements 
manufactured elsewhere than in the final position in the structure. In the structure, 
elements are connected to ensure the required structural integrity. 
1.5.2.2 Plain or lightly reinforced concrete members. Structural concrete members having 
no reinforcement (plain concrete) or less reinforcement than the minimum amounts 
defined in Section 9. 
1.5.2.3 Unbonded and external tendons. Unbonded tendons for post-tensioned members 
having ducts which are permanently ungrouted, and tendons external to the concrete 
cross-section (which may be encased in concrete after stressing, or have a protective 
membrane). 
1.5.2.4 Prestress. The process of prestressing consists in applying forces to the concrete 
structure by stressing tendons relative to the concrete member. "Prestress" is used 
globally to name all the permanent effects of the prestressing process, which comprise 
internal forces in the sections and deformations of the structure. Other means of 
prestressing are not considered in this standard.

SECTION 2 BASIS OF DESIGN 
2.1 Requirements 
2.1.1 Basic requirements 
(1)P The design of concrete structures shall be in accordance with the general rules given in 
EN 1990. 
(2)P The supplementary provisions for concrete structures given in this section shall also be 
applied. 
(3) The basic requirements of EN 1990 Section 2 are deemed to be satisfied for concrete 
structures when the following are applied together: 
-limit state design in conjunction with the partial factor method in accordance with 
EN 1990, 
-actions in accordance with EN 1991, 
-combination of actions in accordance with EN 1990 and 
-resistances, durability and serviceability in accordance with this Standard. 
Note: Requirements for fire resistance (see EN 1990 Section 5 and EN 1992-1-2) may dictate a greater size 
of member than that required for structural resistance at normal temperature. 
2.1.2 Reliability management 
(1) The rules for reliability management are given in EN 1990 Section 2. 
(2) A design using the partial factors given in this Eurocode (see 2.4) and the partial factors 
given in the EN 1990 annexes is considered to lead to a structure associated with reliability 
Class RC2. 
Note: For further information see EN 1990 Annexes Band C. 
2.1.3 Design working life, durability and quality management 
(1) The rules for design working life, durability and quality nlanagement are given in EN 1990 
Section 2. 
2.2 Principles of limit state design 
(1) The rules for limit state design are given in EN 1990 Section 3. 
2.3 Basic variables 
2.3.1 Actions and environmental influences 
2.3.1.1 General 
(1) Actions to be used in design may be obtained fron1 the relevant parts of EN 1991. 
Note 1: The relevant parts of EN1991 for use in design include:

Note 2: Actions specific to this Standard are given in the relevant sections. 
Note 3: Actions from earth and water pressure may be obtained from EN 1997. 
Note 4: When differential movements are taken into account, appropriate estimate values of predicted 
movements may be used. 
Note 5: Other actions, when relevant, may be defined in the design specification for a particular project. 
2.3.1.2 Thermal effects 
(1) Thermal effects should be taken into account when checking serviceability limit states. 
(2) Thermal effects should be considered for ultimate limit states only where they are 
significant (e.g. fatigue conditions, in the verification of stability where second order effects are 
of importance, etc). In other cases they need not be considered, provided that the ductility and 
rotation capacity of the elements are sufficient. 
(3) Where thermal effects are taken into account they should be considered as variable 
actions and applied with a partial factor and lj/factor. 
Note: The IjIfactor is defined in the relevant annex of EN 1990 and EN 1991-1-5. 
2.3.1.3 Differential settlements/movenlents 
(1) Differential settlements/movements of the structure due to soil subsidence should be 
classified as a permanent action, Gset which is introduced as such in combinations of actions. In 
general, Gset is represented by a set of values corresponding to differences (compared to a 
reference level) of settlements/movements between individual foundations or part of 
foundations, dset,i (i denotes the number of the individual foundation or part of foundation). 
Note: Where differential settlements are taken into account, appropriate estimate values of predicted 
settlements may be used. 
(2) The effects of differential settlements should generally be taken into account for the 
verification for serviceability limit states. 
(3) For ultimate limit states they should be considered only where they are significant (e.g. 
fatigue conditions, in the verification of stability where second order effects are of importance, 
etc). In other cases for ultimate limit states they need not be considered, provided that the 
ductility and rotation capacity of the elements are sufficient. 
(4) Where differential settlements are taken into account a partial safety factor for settlement 
effects should be applied.

EN 1992-1-1:2004 (E) 
Note: The value of the partial safety factor for settlement effects is defined in the relevant annex of EN1990. 
2.3.1.4 Prestress 
(1)P The prestress considered in this Eurocode is applied by tendons made of high-strength 
steel (wires, strands or bars). 
(2) Tendons may be embedded in the concrete. They may be pre-tensioned and bonded or 
post-tensioned and bonded or unbonded. 
(3) Tendons may also be external to the structure with points of contact occurring at deviators 
and anchorages. 
(4) Provisions concerning prestress are found in 5.10. 
2.3.2 Material and product properties 
2.3.2.1 General 
(1) The rules for material and product properties are given in EN 1990 Section 4. 
(2) Provisions for concrete, reinforcement and prestressing steel are given in Section 3 or the 
relevant Product Standard. 
2.3.2.2 Shrinkage and creep 
(1) Shrinkage and creep are time-dependent properties of concrete. Their effects should 
generally be taken into account for the verification of serviceability limit states. 
(2) The effects of shrinkage and creep should be considered at ultimate limit states only where 
their effects are significant, for example in the verification of ultimate limit states of stability 
where second order effects are of importance. In other cases these effects need not be 
considered for ultimate limit states, provided that ductility and rotation capacity of the elements 
are sufficient. 
(3) When creep is taken into account its design effects should be evaluated under the quasi¬≠
permanent combination of actions irrespective of the design situation considered i.e. persistent, 
transient or accidental. 
Note: In most cases the effects of creep may be evaluated under permanent loads and the mean value of 
prestress. 
2.3.3 Deformations of concrete 
(1)P The consequences of deformation due to temperature, creep and shrinkage shall be 
considered in design. 
(2) The influence of these effects is normally accommodated by complying with the application 
rules of this Standard. Consideration should also be given to: 
22 minimising deformation and cracking due to early-age movement, creep and shrinkage 
through the composition of the concrete mix; 
minimising restraints to deformation by the provision of bearings or joints;

EN 1992-1-1:2004 (E) 
if restraints are present, ensuring that their influence is taken into account in design. 
(3) In building structures, temperature and shrinkage effects may be omitted in global analysis 
provided joints are incorporated at every distance djoint to accommodate resulting deformations. 
Note: The value of djoint is subject to a National Annex. The recommended value is 30 m. For precast concrete 
structures the value may be larger than that for cast in-situ structures, since part of the creep and shrinkage 
takes place before erection. 
2.3.4 Geometric data 
2.3.4.1 General 
(1) The rules for geometric data are given in EN 1990 Section 4. 
2.3.4.2 Supplementary requirements for cast in place piles 
(1)P Uncertainties related to the cross-section of cast in place piles and concreting procedures 
shall be allowed for in design. 
(2) In the absence of other provisions the diameter used in design calculations, of cast in place 
piles without permanent casing should be taken as: 
-if dnom < 400 mm d = dnom -20 mm 
-if 400 S;; dnom S; 1000 mm d = 0,95.d nom 
-if dnom> 1000 mm d = dnom -50 mm 
Where dnom is the norrlinal diameter of the pile. 
2.4 Verification by the partial factor method

(1) The rules for the partial factor nlethod are given in EN 1990 Section 6. 
2.4.2 Design values 
2.4.2.1 Partial factor for shrinkage action 
(1) Where consideration of shrinkage actions is required for ultimate limit state a partial factor, 
YSH, should be used. 
Note: The value of YSH for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The recommended value is 1,0. 
2.4.2.2 Partial factors for prestress 
(1) Prestress in most situations is intended to be favourable and for the ultimate limit state 
verification the value of tp,fav should be used. The design value of prestress nlay be based on 
the mean value of the prestressing force (see EN 1990 Section 4). 
Note: The value of }'P,fav for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The recommended value for 
persistent and transient design situations is 1,0. This value may also be used for fatigue verification.

EN 1992-1-1:2004 (E) 
(2) In the verification of the limit state for stability with external prestress, where an increase of 
the value of prestress can be unfavourable, )'P,unfav should be used. 
Note: The value of }1:>,unfav in the stability limit state for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The 
recommended value for global analysis is 1,3. 
(3) In the verification of local effects )'P,unfav should also be used. 
Note: The value of }1:>,unfav for local effects for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The 
recommended value is 1,2. The local effects of the anchorage of pre-tensioned tendons are considered in 
8.10.2.

1,0. 
2.4.2.4 Partial factors for materials 
(1) Partial factors for materials for ultimate limit states, rc and rs should be used. 
Note: The values of and rs for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The recommended 
values for 'persistent & transient' and 'accidental, design situations are given in Table 2.1 N. These are not valid 
for fire design for which reference should be made to EN 1992-1-2. 
For fatigue verification the partial factors for persistent design situations given in Table 2.1 N are recommended 
for the values of YC,fat and YS,fat. 
Table 2.1 N: Partial factors for materials for ultimate limit states 
Design situations Yc for concrete Ys for reinforcing steel Ys for prestressing steel 
Persistent & Transient 1,5 1,15 1,15 
Accidental 1,2 1,0 1,0 
(2) The values for partial factors for materials for serviceability limit state verification should be 
taken as those given in the particular clauses of this Eurocode. 
Note: The values of Yc and Ys in the serviceability limit state for use in a Country may be found in its National 
Annex. The recommended value for situations not covered by particular clauses of this Eurocode is 1,0. 
(3) Lower values of rc and rs may be used if justified by measures reducing the uncertainty in 
the calculated resistance. 
Note: Information is given in Informative Annex A. 
2.4.2.5 Partial factors for materials for foundations 
(1) Design values of strength properties of the ground should be calculated in accordance with 
EN 1997. 
(2) The partial factor for concrete rc given in 2.4.2.4 (1) should be multiplied by a factor, kf, for 
calculation of design resistance of cast in place piles without permanent casing.

2.4.3 Combinations of actions 
(1) The general formats for combinations of actions for the ultimate and serviceability limit 
states are given in EN 1990, Section 6. 
Note 1: Detailed expressions for combinations of actions are given in the normative annexes of EN 1990, i.e. 
Annex A 1 for buildings, A2 for bridges, etc. with relevant recommended values for partial factors and 
representative values of actions given in the notes. 
Note 2: Combination of actions for fatigue verification is given in 6.8.3. 
(2) For each permanent action either the lower or the upper design value (whichever gives the 
more unfavourable effect) should be applied throughout the structure (e.g. self-weight in a 
structure ). 
Note: There may be some exceptions to this rule (e.g. in the verification of static equilibrium, see EN 1990 
Section 6). In such cases a different set of partial factors (Set A) may be used. An example valid for buildings is 
given in Annex A 1 of EN 1990. 
2.4.4 Verification of static equilibrium -EQU 
(1) The reliability format for the verification of static equilibrium also applies to design situations 
of EQU, such as holding down devices or the verification of the uplift of bearings for continuous 
beams. 
Note: Information is given in Annex A of EN 1990.

Note: Information is given in Section 5 and Annex 0 of EN 1990. 
2.6 Supplementary requirements for foundations 
(1)P Where ground-structure interaction has significant influence on the action effects in the 
structure, the properties of the soil and the effects of the interaction shall be taken into account 
in accordance with EN 1997-1. 
(2) Where significant differential settlements are likely their influence on the action effects in 
the structure should be checked. 
Note 1: Annex G may be used to model the soil -structure interaction. 
Note 2: Simple methods ignoring the effects of ground deformation are normally appropriate for the majority of 
structural designs. 
(3) Concrete foundations should be sized in accordance with EN 1997-1. 
(4) Where relevant, the design should include the effects of phenomena such as subsidence, 
heave, freezing, thawing, erosion, etc.

2.7 Requirements for fastenings 
(1) The local and structural effects of fasteners should be considered. 
26 Note: The requirements for the design of fastenings are given in the Technical Specification 'Design of 
Fastenings for Use in Concrete' (under development). This Technical Specification will cover the design of the 
following types of fasteners: 
cast-in fasteners such as: 
headed anchors, 
-channel bars, 
and post-installed fasteners such as: 
-expansion anchors, 
-undercut anchors, 
-concrete screws, 
-bonded anchors, 
-bonded expansion anchors and 
-bonded undercut anchors. 
The performance of fasteners should comply with the requirements of a CEN Standard or should be 
demonstrated by a European Technical Approval. 
The Technical Specification 'Design of Fastenings' for Use in Concrete' includes the local transmission of loads 
into the structure. 
In the design of the structure the loads and additional design requirements given in Annex A of that Technical 
Specification should be taken into account.

SECTION 3 MATERIALS 
3.1 Concrete 
3.1.1 General 
(1)P The following clauses give principles and rules for normal and high strength concrete. 
(2) Rules for lightweight aggregate concrete are given in Section 11. 
3.1.2 Strength 
(1)P The compressive strength of concrete is denoted by concrete strength classes which 
relate to the characteristic (5%) cylinder strength fCk' or the cube strength fck,eube, in accordance 
with EN 206-1. 
(2)P The strength classes in this code are based on the characteristic cylinder strength fek 
determined at 28 days with a maximum value of Cmax. 
Note: The value of Cmax for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The recommended value is 
C90/105. 
(3) The characteristic strengths for fek and the corresponding mechanical characteristics 
necessary for design, are given in Table 3.1. 
(4) In certain situations (e.g. prestressing) it may be appropriate to assess the compressive 
strength for concrete before or after 28 days, on the basis of test specimens stored under other 
conditions than prescribed in EN 12390. 
If the concrete strength is determined at an age t > 28 days the values ace and aet defined in 
3.1.6 (1)P and 3.1.6 (2)P should be reduced by a factor kt. 
Note: The value of kt for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The recommended value is 0,85. 
(5) It may be required to specify the concrete compressive strength, fek(t) , at time t for a 
number of stages (e.g. demoulding, transfer of prestress), where 
fek(t) = fem(t) -8 (MPa) for 3 < t < 28 days. 
fek(t) = fek for t z 28 days 
More precise values should be based on tests especially for t:::; 3 days 
(6) The compressive strength of concrete at an age t depends on the type of cement, 
temperature and curing conditions. For a mean temperature of 20¬∞C and curing in accordance 
with EN 12390 the compressive strength of concrete at various ages fem(t) may be estimated 
from Expressions (3.1) and (3.2). 
fem( t) = (3ee( t) fem 
with 
JUt)=exp{+ (2n J} 
where: 
fem(t) is the mean concrete compressive strength at an age of t days (3.1 ) 
(3.2) 
27 

=== PAGE 30 ===

BS EN 1992-1-1:2004 
EN 1992-1-1:2004 (E) 
fem is the mean compressive strength at 28 days according to Table 3.1 
f3ee(t) is a coefficient which depends on the age of the concrete t 
t is the age of the concrete in days 
s is a coefficient which depends on the type of cement: 
= 0,20 for cement of strength Classes CEM 42,5 R, CEM 52,5 Nand CEM 52,5 R 
(Class R) 
= 0,25 for cement of strength Classes CEM 32,5 R, CEM 42,5 N (Class N) 
= 0,38 for cement of strength Classes CEM 32,5 N (Class S) 
Note: exp{} has the same meaning as e( ) 
Where the concrete does not conform with the specification for compressive strength at 28 days 
the use of Expressions (3.1) and (3.2) is not appropriate. 
This clause should not be used retrospectively to justify a non conforming reference strength by 
a later increase of the strength. 
For situations where heat curing is applied to the member see 10.3.1.1 (3). 
(7)P The tensile strength refers to the highest stress reached under concentric tensile loading. 
For the flexural tensile strength reference should be made to 3.1.8 (1). 
(8) Where the tensile strength is determined as the splitting tensile strength, fet,sp, an 
approximate value of the axial tensile strength, fet, may be taken as: 
fet 0,9fet,sp (3.3) 
(9) The development of tensile strength with time is strongly influenced by curing and drying 
conditions as well as by the dimensions of the structural members. As a first approximation it 
may be assumed that the tensile strength fetm(t) is equal to: 
fetm(t) = (jJee(t) t¬∑ fetm 
where jJee(t) follows from Expression (3.2) and 
a 1 for t < 28 
a = 2/3 for t ~ 28. The values for fetm are given in Table 3.1. (3.4) 
Note: Where the development of the tensile strength with time is important it is recommended that tests are 
carried out taking into account the exposure conditions and the dimensions of the structural member. 
3.1.3 Elastic deformation 
(1) The elastic deformations of concrete largely depend on its composition (especially the 
aggregates). The values given in this Standard should be regarded as indicative for general 
applications. However, they should be specifically assessed if the structure is likely to be 
sensitive to deviations from these general values. 
(2) The modulus of elasticity of a concrete is controlled by the moduli of elasticity of its 
components. Approximate values for the modulus of elasticity Eem, secant value between O"c = 0 
and O,4fem, for concretes with quartzite aggregates, are given in Table 3.1. For limestone and 
sandstone aggregates the value should be reduced by 10% and 30% respectively. For basalt 
aggregates the value should be increased by 20%. 
Note: A Country's National Annex may refer to non-contradictory complementary information.
