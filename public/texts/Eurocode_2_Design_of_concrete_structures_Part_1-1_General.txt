This European Standard EN 1992, Eurocode 2: Design of concrete structures: General rules 
and rules for buildings, has been prepared by Technical Conlrnittee CEN/TC250 ¬´ Structural 
Eurocodes ¬ª, the Secretariat of which is held by BSI. CEN/TC250 is responsible for all 
Structural Eurocodes. 
This European Standard shall be given the status of a National Standard, either by publication 
of an identical text or by endorsement, at the latest by June 2005, and conflicting National 
Standards shall be withdrawn at latest by March 2010. 
This Eurocode supersedes ENV 1992-1-1,1992-1-3,1992-1-4,1992-1-5,1992-1-6 and 1992-3. 
According to the CEN-CENELEC Internal Regulations, the National Standard Organisations of 
the following countries are bound to implement these European Standard: Austria, Belgium, 
Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary,

Background to the Eurocode programme 
In 1975, the Comnlission of the European Community decided on an action programme in the 
field of construction, based on article 95 of the Treaty. The objective of the programme was the 
elimination of technical obstacles to trade and the harmonisation of technical specifications. 
Within this action programme, the Commission took the initiative to establish a set of 
harmonised technical rules for the design of construction works which, in a first stage, would 
serve as an alternative to the national rules in force in the Member States and, ultimately, would 
replace them. 
For fifteen years, the Commission, with the help of a Steering Comnlittee with Representatives 
of Member States, conducted the development of the Eurocodes programme, which led to the 
first generation of European codes in the 1980s. 
In 1989, the Commission and the Member States of the EU and EFTA decided, on the basis of 
an agreement1 between the Commission and CEN, to transfer the preparation and the 
publication of the Eurocodes to CEN through a series of Mandates, in order to provide them 
with a future status of European Standard (EN). This links de facto the Eurocodes with the 
provisions of all the Council's Directives and/or Commission's Decisions dealing with European 
standards (e.g. the Council Directive 89/106/EEC on construction products -CPD -and Council 
Directives 93/37/EEC, 92/50/EEC and 89/440/EEC on public works and services and equivalent 
EFTA Directives initiated in pursuit of setting up the internal market). 
The Structural Eurocode programme comprises the following standards generally consisting of 
a number of Parts: 
EN 1990 Eurocode 0: Basis of Structural Design 
EN 1991 Eurocode 1: Actions on structures 
EN 1992 Eurocode 2: Design of concrete structures 
EN 1993 Eurocode 3: Design of steel structures 
EN 1994 Eurocode 4: Design of composite steel and concrete structures 
EN 1995 Eurocode 5: Design of timber structures 
EN 1996 Eurocode 6: Design of masonry structures 
EN 1997 Eurocode 7: Geotechnical design 
EN 1998 Eurocode 8: Design of structures for earthquake resistance 
EN 1999 Eurocode 9: Design of aluminium structures 
Eurocode standards recognise the responsibility of regulatory authorities in each Member State 
and have safeguarded their right to determine values related to regulatory safety matters at 
national level where these continue to vary from State to State. 
Status and field of application of eurocodes 
The Member States of the EU and EFTA recognise that Eurocodes serve as reference 
documents for the following purposes: 
as a means to prove compliance of building and civil engineering works with the essential 
Agreement between the Commission of the European Communities and the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) concerning the work 
on EUROCODES for the design of building and civil engineering works (BC/CEN/03/89).

requirements of Council Directive 89/106/EEC, particularly Essential Requirement N¬∞1 -
Mechanical resistance and stability -and Essential Requirement N¬∞2 -Safety in case of fire; 
as a basis for specifying contracts for construction works and related engineering services; 
as a framework for drawing up harmonised technical specifications for construction products 
(ENs and ETAs) 
The Eurocodes, as far as they concern the construction works themselves, have a direct 
relationship with the Interpretative Documents2 referred to in Article 12 of the CPO, although 
they are of a different nature from harmonised product standards3. Therefore, technical aspects 
arising from the Eurocodes work need to be adequately considered by CEN Technical 
Committees and/or EOTA Working Groups working on product standards with a view to 
achieving full compatibility of these technical specifications with the Eurocodes. 
The Eurocode standards provide common structural design rules for everyday use for the 
design of whole structures and conlponent products of both a traditional and an innovative 
nature. Unusual forms of construction or design conditions are not specifically covered and 
additional expert consideration will be required by the designer in such cases.

The National Standards implementing Eurocodes will comprise the full text of the Eurocode 
(including any annexes), as published by CEN, which may be preceded by a National title page 
and National foreword, and may be followed by a National annex. 
The National annex may only contain information on those parameters which are left open in 
the Eurocode for national choice, known as Nationally Determined Parameters, to be used for 
the design of buildings and civil engineering works to be constructed in the country concerned, 
i.e. : 
values and/or classes where alternatives are given in the Eurocode, 
values to be used where a symbol only is given in the Eurocode, 
country specific data (geographical, climatic, etc.), e.g. snow map, 
the procedure to be used where alternative procedures are given in the Eurocode. 
It may contain 
decisions on the application of informative annexes, 
-references to non-contradictory complementary information to assist the user to apply the 
Eurocode. 
Links between Eurocodes and harmonised technical specifications (ENs and ETAs) for 
products 
There is a need for consistency between the harmonised technical specifications for 
2 According to Art. 3.3 of the CPO, the essential requirements (ERs) shall be given concrete form in interpretative documents for the creation of the 
3 necessary links between the essential requirements and the mandates for harmonised ENs and ETAGs/ETAs. 
According to Art. 12 of the CPD the interpretative documents shall: 
a) give concrete form to the essential requirements by harmonising the terminology and the technical bases and indicating classes or levels for 
each requirement where necessary ; 
b) indicate methods of correlating these classes or levels of requirement with the technical specifications, e.g. methods of calculation and of 
proof, technical rules for project design, etc. ; 
c) serve as a reference for the establishment of harmonised standards and guidelines for European technical approvals. 
The Eurocodes, de facto, playa similar role in the field of the ER 1 and a part of ER 2.

construction products and the technical rules for works4. Furthermore, all the information 
accompanying the CE Marking of the construction products which refer to Eurocodes should 
clearly mention which Nationally Determined Parameters have been taken into account. 
Additional information specific to EN 1992-1-1 
EN 1992-1-1 describes the principles and requirements for safety, serviceability and durability 
of concrete structures, together with specific provisions for buildings. It is based on the limit 
state concept used in conjunction with a partial factor method. 
For the design of new structures, EN 1992-1-1 is intended to be used, for direct application, 
together with other parts of EN 1992, Eurocodes EN 1990,1991, 1997 and 1998. 
EN 1992-1-1 also serves as a reference document for other CEN TCs concerning structural 
matters. 
EN 1992-1-1 is intended for use by: 
committees drafting other standards for structural design and related product, testing and 
execution standards; 
-clients (e.g. for the formulation of their specific requirements on reliability levels and durability); 
designers and constructors; 
-relevant authorities. 
Numerical values for partial factors and other reliability parameters are recommended as basic 
values that provide an acceptable level of reliability. They have been selected assuming that an 
appropriate level of workmanship and of quality management applies. When EN 1992-1-1 is 
used as a base document by other CENITCs the same values need to be taken. 
National annex for EN 1992-1-1 
This standard gives values with notes indicating where national choices may have to be made. 
Therefore the National Standard implementing EN 1992-1-1 should have a National annex 
containing all Nationally Determined Parameters to be used for the design of buildings and civil 
engineering works to be constructed in the relevant country. 
National choice is allowed in EN 1992-1-1 through the following clauses: 
4 see Art.3.3 and Art.12 of the CPD, as well as clauses 4.2, 4.3.1,4.3.2 and 5.2 of ID 1.

=== PAGE 18 ===

BS EN 1992-1-1:2004 
EN 1992-1-1:2004 (E) 
-Adequate supervision and quality control is provided in factories, in plants, and on site. 
-Construction is carried out by personnel having the appropriate skill and experience. 
-The construction materials and products are used as specified in this Eurocode or in the 
relevant material or product specifications.

The requirements for execution and workmanship given in ENV 13670 are complied with. 
1.4 Distinction between principles and application rules 
(1)P The rules given in EN 1990 apply. 
1.5 Definitions 
1.5.1 General 
(1)P The terms and definitions given in EN 1990 apply. 
1.5.2 Additional terms and definitions used in this Standard 
1.5.2.1 Precast structures. Precast structures are characterised by structural elements 
manufactured elsewhere than in the final position in the structure. In the structure, 
elements are connected to ensure the required structural integrity. 
1.5.2.2 Plain or lightly reinforced concrete members. Structural concrete members having 
no reinforcement (plain concrete) or less reinforcement than the minimum amounts 
defined in Section 9. 
1.5.2.3 Unbonded and external tendons. Unbonded tendons for post-tensioned members 
having ducts which are permanently ungrouted, and tendons external to the concrete 
cross-section (which may be encased in concrete after stressing, or have a protective 
membrane). 
1.5.2.4 Prestress. The process of prestressing consists in applying forces to the concrete 
structure by stressing tendons relative to the concrete member. "Prestress" is used 
globally to name all the permanent effects of the prestressing process, which comprise 
internal forces in the sections and deformations of the structure. Other means of 
prestressing are not considered in this standard.

SECTION 2 BASIS OF DESIGN 
2.1 Requirements 
2.1.1 Basic requirements 
(1)P The design of concrete structures shall be in accordance with the general rules given in 
EN 1990. 
(2)P The supplementary provisions for concrete structures given in this section shall also be 
applied. 
(3) The basic requirements of EN 1990 Section 2 are deemed to be satisfied for concrete 
structures when the following are applied together: 
-limit state design in conjunction with the partial factor method in accordance with 
EN 1990, 
-actions in accordance with EN 1991, 
-combination of actions in accordance with EN 1990 and 
-resistances, durability and serviceability in accordance with this Standard. 
Note: Requirements for fire resistance (see EN 1990 Section 5 and EN 1992-1-2) may dictate a greater size 
of member than that required for structural resistance at normal temperature. 
2.1.2 Reliability management 
(1) The rules for reliability management are given in EN 1990 Section 2. 
(2) A design using the partial factors given in this Eurocode (see 2.4) and the partial factors 
given in the EN 1990 annexes is considered to lead to a structure associated with reliability 
Class RC2. 
Note: For further information see EN 1990 Annexes Band C. 
2.1.3 Design working life, durability and quality management 
(1) The rules for design working life, durability and quality nlanagement are given in EN 1990 
Section 2. 
2.2 Principles of limit state design 
(1) The rules for limit state design are given in EN 1990 Section 3. 
2.3 Basic variables 
2.3.1 Actions and environmental influences 
2.3.1.1 General 
(1) Actions to be used in design may be obtained fron1 the relevant parts of EN 1991. 
Note 1: The relevant parts of EN1991 for use in design include:

Note 2: Actions specific to this Standard are given in the relevant sections. 
Note 3: Actions from earth and water pressure may be obtained from EN 1997. 
Note 4: When differential movements are taken into account, appropriate estimate values of predicted 
movements may be used. 
Note 5: Other actions, when relevant, may be defined in the design specification for a particular project. 
2.3.1.2 Thermal effects 
(1) Thermal effects should be taken into account when checking serviceability limit states. 
(2) Thermal effects should be considered for ultimate limit states only where they are 
significant (e.g. fatigue conditions, in the verification of stability where second order effects are 
of importance, etc). In other cases they need not be considered, provided that the ductility and 
rotation capacity of the elements are sufficient. 
(3) Where thermal effects are taken into account they should be considered as variable 
actions and applied with a partial factor and lj/factor. 
Note: The IjIfactor is defined in the relevant annex of EN 1990 and EN 1991-1-5. 
2.3.1.3 Differential settlements/movenlents 
(1) Differential settlements/movements of the structure due to soil subsidence should be 
classified as a permanent action, Gset which is introduced as such in combinations of actions. In 
general, Gset is represented by a set of values corresponding to differences (compared to a 
reference level) of settlements/movements between individual foundations or part of 
foundations, dset,i (i denotes the number of the individual foundation or part of foundation). 
Note: Where differential settlements are taken into account, appropriate estimate values of predicted 
settlements may be used. 
(2) The effects of differential settlements should generally be taken into account for the 
verification for serviceability limit states. 
(3) For ultimate limit states they should be considered only where they are significant (e.g. 
fatigue conditions, in the verification of stability where second order effects are of importance, 
etc). In other cases for ultimate limit states they need not be considered, provided that the 
ductility and rotation capacity of the elements are sufficient. 
(4) Where differential settlements are taken into account a partial safety factor for settlement 
effects should be applied.

EN 1992-1-1:2004 (E) 
Note: The value of the partial safety factor for settlement effects is defined in the relevant annex of EN1990. 
2.3.1.4 Prestress 
(1)P The prestress considered in this Eurocode is applied by tendons made of high-strength 
steel (wires, strands or bars). 
(2) Tendons may be embedded in the concrete. They may be pre-tensioned and bonded or 
post-tensioned and bonded or unbonded. 
(3) Tendons may also be external to the structure with points of contact occurring at deviators 
and anchorages. 
(4) Provisions concerning prestress are found in 5.10. 
2.3.2 Material and product properties 
2.3.2.1 General 
(1) The rules for material and product properties are given in EN 1990 Section 4. 
(2) Provisions for concrete, reinforcement and prestressing steel are given in Section 3 or the 
relevant Product Standard. 
2.3.2.2 Shrinkage and creep 
(1) Shrinkage and creep are time-dependent properties of concrete. Their effects should 
generally be taken into account for the verification of serviceability limit states. 
(2) The effects of shrinkage and creep should be considered at ultimate limit states only where 
their effects are significant, for example in the verification of ultimate limit states of stability 
where second order effects are of importance. In other cases these effects need not be 
considered for ultimate limit states, provided that ductility and rotation capacity of the elements 
are sufficient. 
(3) When creep is taken into account its design effects should be evaluated under the quasi¬≠
permanent combination of actions irrespective of the design situation considered i.e. persistent, 
transient or accidental. 
Note: In most cases the effects of creep may be evaluated under permanent loads and the mean value of 
prestress. 
2.3.3 Deformations of concrete 
(1)P The consequences of deformation due to temperature, creep and shrinkage shall be 
considered in design. 
(2) The influence of these effects is normally accommodated by complying with the application 
rules of this Standard. Consideration should also be given to: 
22 minimising deformation and cracking due to early-age movement, creep and shrinkage 
through the composition of the concrete mix; 
minimising restraints to deformation by the provision of bearings or joints; 

=== PAGE 25 ===

BS EN 1992-1-1:2004 
EN 1992-1-1:2004 (E) 
if restraints are present, ensuring that their influence is taken into account in design. 
(3) In building structures, temperature and shrinkage effects may be omitted in global analysis 
provided joints are incorporated at every distance djoint to accommodate resulting deformations. 
Note: The value of djoint is subject to a National Annex. The recommended value is 30 m. For precast concrete 
structures the value may be larger than that for cast in-situ structures, since part of the creep and shrinkage 
takes place before erection. 
2.3.4 Geometric data 
2.3.4.1 General 
(1) The rules for geometric data are given in EN 1990 Section 4. 
2.3.4.2 Supplementary requirements for cast in place piles 
(1)P Uncertainties related to the cross-section of cast in place piles and concreting procedures 
shall be allowed for in design. 
(2) In the absence of other provisions the diameter used in design calculations, of cast in place 
piles without permanent casing should be taken as: 
-if dnom < 400 mm d = dnom -20 mm 
-if 400 S;; dnom S; 1000 mm d = 0,95.d nom 
-if dnom> 1000 mm d = dnom -50 mm 
Where dnom is the norrlinal diameter of the pile. 
2.4 Verification by the partial factor method 
2.4.1 General 
(1) The rules for the partial factor nlethod are given in EN 1990 Section 6. 
2.4.2 Design values 
2.4.2.1 Partial factor for shrinkage action 
(1) Where consideration of shrinkage actions is required for ultimate limit state a partial factor, 
YSH, should be used. 
Note: The value of YSH for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The recommended value is 1,0. 
2.4.2.2 Partial factors for prestress 
(1) Prestress in most situations is intended to be favourable and for the ultimate limit state 
verification the value of tp,fav should be used. The design value of prestress nlay be based on 
the mean value of the prestressing force (see EN 1990 Section 4). 
Note: The value of }'P,fav for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The recommended value for 
persistent and transient design situations is 1,0. This value may also be used for fatigue verification.

EN 1992-1-1:2004 (E) 
(2) In the verification of the limit state for stability with external prestress, where an increase of 
the value of prestress can be unfavourable, )'P,unfav should be used. 
Note: The value of }1:>,unfav in the stability limit state for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The 
recommended value for global analysis is 1,3. 
(3) In the verification of local effects )'P,unfav should also be used. 
Note: The value of }1:>,unfav for local effects for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The 
recommended value is 1,2. The local effects of the anchorage of pre-tensioned tendons are considered in 
8.10.2. 
2.4.2.3 Partial factor for fatigue loads 
(1) The partial factor for fatigue loads is (F,fat. 
Note: The value of }F,fat for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The recommended value is 
1,0. 
2.4.2.4 Partial factors for materials 
(1) Partial factors for materials for ultimate limit states, rc and rs should be used. 
Note: The values of and rs for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The recommended 
values for 'persistent & transient' and 'accidental, design situations are given in Table 2.1 N. These are not valid 
for fire design for which reference should be made to EN 1992-1-2. 
For fatigue verification the partial factors for persistent design situations given in Table 2.1 N are recommended 
for the values of YC,fat and YS,fat. 
Table 2.1 N: Partial factors for materials for ultimate limit states 
Design situations Yc for concrete Ys for reinforcing steel Ys for prestressing steel 
Persistent & Transient 1,5 1,15 1,15

(2) The values for partial factors for materials for serviceability limit state verification should be 
taken as those given in the particular clauses of this Eurocode. 
Note: The values of Yc and Ys in the serviceability limit state for use in a Country may be found in its National 
Annex. The recommended value for situations not covered by particular clauses of this Eurocode is 1,0. 
(3) Lower values of rc and rs may be used if justified by measures reducing the uncertainty in 
the calculated resistance. 
Note: Information is given in Informative Annex A. 
2.4.2.5 Partial factors for materials for foundations 
(1) Design values of strength properties of the ground should be calculated in accordance with 
EN 1997. 
(2) The partial factor for concrete rc given in 2.4.2.4 (1) should be multiplied by a factor, kf, for 
calculation of design resistance of cast in place piles without permanent casing.

2.4.3 Combinations of actions 
(1) The general formats for combinations of actions for the ultimate and serviceability limit 
states are given in EN 1990, Section 6. 
Note 1: Detailed expressions for combinations of actions are given in the normative annexes of EN 1990, i.e. 
Annex A 1 for buildings, A2 for bridges, etc. with relevant recommended values for partial factors and 
representative values of actions given in the notes. 
Note 2: Combination of actions for fatigue verification is given in 6.8.3. 
(2) For each permanent action either the lower or the upper design value (whichever gives the 
more unfavourable effect) should be applied throughout the structure (e.g. self-weight in a 
structure ). 
Note: There may be some exceptions to this rule (e.g. in the verification of static equilibrium, see EN 1990 
Section 6). In such cases a different set of partial factors (Set A) may be used. An example valid for buildings is 
given in Annex A 1 of EN 1990. 
2.4.4 Verification of static equilibrium -EQU 
(1) The reliability format for the verification of static equilibrium also applies to design situations 
of EQU, such as holding down devices or the verification of the uplift of bearings for continuous 
beams. 
Note: Information is given in Annex A of EN 1990. 
2.5 Design assisted by testing 
(1) The design of structures or structural elements may be assisted by testing. 
Note: Information is given in Section 5 and Annex 0 of EN 1990. 
2.6 Supplementary requirements for foundations 
(1)P Where ground-structure interaction has significant influence on the action effects in the 
structure, the properties of the soil and the effects of the interaction shall be taken into account 
in accordance with EN 1997-1. 
(2) Where significant differential settlements are likely their influence on the action effects in 
the structure should be checked. 
Note 1: Annex G may be used to model the soil -structure interaction. 
Note 2: Simple methods ignoring the effects of ground deformation are normally appropriate for the majority of 
structural designs. 
(3) Concrete foundations should be sized in accordance with EN 1997-1. 
(4) Where relevant, the design should include the effects of phenomena such as subsidence, 
heave, freezing, thawing, erosion, etc.

2.7 Requirements for fastenings 
(1) The local and structural effects of fasteners should be considered. 
26 Note: The requirements for the design of fastenings are given in the Technical Specification 'Design of 
Fastenings for Use in Concrete' (under development). This Technical Specification will cover the design of the 
following types of fasteners: 
cast-in fasteners such as: 
headed anchors, 
-channel bars, 
and post-installed fasteners such as: 
-expansion anchors, 
-undercut anchors, 
-concrete screws, 
-bonded anchors, 
-bonded expansion anchors and 
-bonded undercut anchors. 
The performance of fasteners should comply with the requirements of a CEN Standard or should be 
demonstrated by a European Technical Approval. 
The Technical Specification 'Design of Fastenings' for Use in Concrete' includes the local transmission of loads 
into the structure. 
In the design of the structure the loads and additional design requirements given in Annex A of that Technical 
Specification should be taken into account.

SECTION 3 MATERIALS 
3.1 Concrete 
3.1.1 General 
(1)P The following clauses give principles and rules for normal and high strength concrete. 
(2) Rules for lightweight aggregate concrete are given in Section 11. 
3.1.2 Strength 
(1)P The compressive strength of concrete is denoted by concrete strength classes which 
relate to the characteristic (5%) cylinder strength fCk' or the cube strength fck,eube, in accordance 
with EN 206-1. 
(2)P The strength classes in this code are based on the characteristic cylinder strength fek 
determined at 28 days with a maximum value of Cmax. 
Note: The value of Cmax for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The recommended value is 
C90/105. 
(3) The characteristic strengths for fek and the corresponding mechanical characteristics 
necessary for design, are given in Table 3.1. 
(4) In certain situations (e.g. prestressing) it may be appropriate to assess the compressive 
strength for concrete before or after 28 days, on the basis of test specimens stored under other 
conditions than prescribed in EN 12390. 
If the concrete strength is determined at an age t > 28 days the values ace and aet defined in 
3.1.6 (1)P and 3.1.6 (2)P should be reduced by a factor kt. 
Note: The value of kt for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The recommended value is 0,85. 
(5) It may be required to specify the concrete compressive strength, fek(t) , at time t for a 
number of stages (e.g. demoulding, transfer of prestress), where 
fek(t) = fem(t) -8 (MPa) for 3 < t < 28 days. 
fek(t) = fek for t z 28 days 
More precise values should be based on tests especially for t:::; 3 days 
(6) The compressive strength of concrete at an age t depends on the type of cement, 
temperature and curing conditions. For a mean temperature of 20¬∞C and curing in accordance 
with EN 12390 the compressive strength of concrete at various ages fem(t) may be estimated 
from Expressions (3.1) and (3.2). 
fem( t) = (3ee( t) fem 
with 
JUt)=exp{+ (2n J} 
where: 
fem(t) is the mean concrete compressive strength at an age of t days (3.1 ) 
(3.2) 
27 

=== PAGE 30 ===

BS EN 1992-1-1:2004 
EN 1992-1-1:2004 (E) 
fem is the mean compressive strength at 28 days according to Table 3.1 
f3ee(t) is a coefficient which depends on the age of the concrete t 
t is the age of the concrete in days 
s is a coefficient which depends on the type of cement: 
= 0,20 for cement of strength Classes CEM 42,5 R, CEM 52,5 Nand CEM 52,5 R 
(Class R) 
= 0,25 for cement of strength Classes CEM 32,5 R, CEM 42,5 N (Class N) 
= 0,38 for cement of strength Classes CEM 32,5 N (Class S) 
Note: exp{} has the same meaning as e( ) 
Where the concrete does not conform with the specification for compressive strength at 28 days 
the use of Expressions (3.1) and (3.2) is not appropriate. 
This clause should not be used retrospectively to justify a non conforming reference strength by 
a later increase of the strength. 
For situations where heat curing is applied to the member see 10.3.1.1 (3). 
(7)P The tensile strength refers to the highest stress reached under concentric tensile loading. 
For the flexural tensile strength reference should be made to 3.1.8 (1). 
(8) Where the tensile strength is determined as the splitting tensile strength, fet,sp, an 
approximate value of the axial tensile strength, fet, may be taken as: 
fet 0,9fet,sp (3.3) 
(9) The development of tensile strength with time is strongly influenced by curing and drying 
conditions as well as by the dimensions of the structural members. As a first approximation it 
may be assumed that the tensile strength fetm(t) is equal to: 
fetm(t) = (jJee(t) t¬∑ fetm 
where jJee(t) follows from Expression (3.2) and 
a 1 for t < 28 
a = 2/3 for t ~ 28. The values for fetm are given in Table 3.1. (3.4) 
Note: Where the development of the tensile strength with time is important it is recommended that tests are 
carried out taking into account the exposure conditions and the dimensions of the structural member. 
3.1.3 Elastic deformation 
(1) The elastic deformations of concrete largely depend on its composition (especially the 
aggregates). The values given in this Standard should be regarded as indicative for general 
applications. However, they should be specifically assessed if the structure is likely to be 
sensitive to deviations from these general values. 
(2) The modulus of elasticity of a concrete is controlled by the moduli of elasticity of its 
components. Approximate values for the modulus of elasticity Eem, secant value between O"c = 0 
and O,4fem, for concretes with quartzite aggregates, are given in Table 3.1. For limestone and 
sandstone aggregates the value should be reduced by 10% and 30% respectively. For basalt 
aggregates the value should be increased by 20%. 
Note: A Country's National Annex may refer to non-contradictory complementary information.

(3) Variation of the modulus of elasticity with time can be estimated by: 
Eem(t) = (fem(t) / fem)0,3 Eem (3.5) 
where Eem(t) and fem(t) are the values at an age of t days and Eem and fem are the values 
determined at an age of 28 days. The relation between fem(t) and fem follows from Expression 
(3.1 ). 
(4) Poisson's ratio may be taken equal to 0,2 for uncracked concrete and ¬∞ for cracked 
concrete. 
(5) Unless more accurate information is available, the linear coefficient of thermal expansion 
may be taken equal to 1 ¬∞ .10-6 K -1. 
3.1.4 Creep and shrinkage 
(1)P Creep and shrinkage of the concrete depend on the ambient humidity, the dimensions of 
the element and the composition of the concrete. Creep is also influenced by the maturity of the 
concrete when the load is first applied and depends on the duration and magnitude of the 
loading. 
(2) The creep coefficient, rp(t,to) is related to Ee, the tangent modulus, which may be taken as 
1,05 Ecm. Where great accuracy is not required, the value found from Figure 3.1 may be 
considered as the creep coefficient, provided that the concrete is not subjected to a 
compressive stress greater than 0,45 fek (to ) at an age to, the age of concrete at the time of 
loading. 
Note: For further information, including the development of creep with time, Annex B may be used. 
(3) The creep deformation of concrete Eee(oo,tO) at time t = 00 for a constant compressive stress 
O"e applied at the concrete age to, is given by: 
(3.6) 
(4) When the compressive stress of concrete at an age to exceeds the value 0,45 fek(tO) then 
creep non-linearity should be considered. Such a high stress can occur as a result of 
pretensioning, e.g. in precast concrete members at tendon level. In such cases the non-linear 
notional creep coefficient should be obtained as follows: 
30 (3.7) 
where: 
(j)nl ( 00, to) is the non-linear notional creep coefficient, which replaces (j) (00, to) 
kG is the stress-strength ratio Oe/fek (to), where Oe is the compressive stress and 
fek (to) is the characteristic concrete compressive strength at the time of 
loading.@il

(5) The values given in Figure 3.1 are valid for ambient temperatures between -40¬∞C and 
+40¬∞C and a mean relative humidity between RH = 40% and RH = 100%. The following 
symbols are used: 
cp (00, to) is the final creep coefficient 
to is the age of the concrete at time of loading in days 
ha is the notional size 2Ae lu, where Ae is the concrete cross-sectional area and u is 
the perimeter of that part which is exposed to drying 
S is Class S, according to 3.1.2 (6) 
N is Class N, according to 3.1.2 (6) 
R is Class R, according to 3.1.2 (6) 
(6) The total shrinkage strain is composed of two components, the drying shrinkage strain and 
the autogenous shrinkage strain. The drying shrinkage strain develops slowly, since it is a 
function of the migration of the water through the hardened concrete. The autogenous 
shrinkage strain develops during hardening of the concrete: the major part therefore develops in 
the early days after casting. Autogenous shrinkage is a linear function of the concrete strength. 
It should be considered specifically when new concrete is cast against hardened concrete. 
Hence the values of the total shrinkage strain &es follow from 
&es = &ed + &ea 
where: 
&es is the total shrinkage strain 
&ed is the drying shrinkage strain 
&ea is the autogenous shrinkage strain (3.8) 
The final value of the drying shrinkage strain, is equal to kh¬∑ced,O. &ed,a. may be taken from 
Table 3.2 (expected mean values, with a coefficient of variation of about 30%). 
Note: The formula for ced,O is given in Annex B.

where: 
Yc is the partial safety factor for concrete, see 2.4.2.4, and 
acc is the coefficient taking account of long term effects on the compressive strength and 
of unfavourable effects resulting from the way the load is applied. 
Note: The value of acc for use in a Country should lie between 0,8 and 1,0 and may be found in its National 
Annex. The recommended value is 1. 
(2)P The value of the design tensile strength, fCtdl is defined as 
fctd = act fctk,Q,Q5 / yc (3.16) 
where: 
yc is the partial safety factor for concrete, see 2.4.2.4, and 
act is a coefficient taking account of long tern1 effects on the tensile strength and of 
unfavourable effects, resulting from the way the load is applied. 
Note: The value of act for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The recommended value is 1,0.

3.1.8 Flexural tensile strength 
(1) The mean flexural tensile strength of reinforced concrete members depends on the mean 
axial tensile strength and the depth of the cross-section. The following relationship may be 
used: 
fctm,fl = max {(1 ,6 -h/1000)f ctm; fctm } 
where: 
h is the total member depth in mm 
fctm is the mean axial tensile strength following from Table 3.1. 
The relation given in Expression (3.23) also applies for the characteristic tensile strength 
values. 
3.1.9 Confined concrete (3.23) 
(1) Confinement of concrete results in a modification of the effective stress-strain relationship: 
higher strength and higher critical strains are achieved. The other basic material characteristics 
may be considered as unaffected for design. 
(2) In the absence of more precise data, the stress-strain relation shown in Figure 3.6 
(compressive strain shown positive) may be used, with increased characteristic strength and 
strains according to:

3.2 Reinforcing steel 
3.2.1 General 
(1)P The following clauses give principles and rules for reinforcement which is in the form of 
bars, de-coiled rods, welded fabric and lattice girders. They do not apply to specially coated 
bars. 
(2)P The requirements for the properties of the reinforcement are for the material as placed in 
the hardened concrete. If site operations can affect the properties of the reinforcement, then 
those properties shall be verified after such operations. 
(3)P Where other steels are used, which are not in accordance with EN10080, the properties 
shall be verified to be in accordance with 3.2.2 to 3.2.6 and Annex C. 
(4)P The required properties of reinforcing steels shall be verified using the testing procedures 
in accordance with EN 10080. 
Note: EN 10080 refers to a yield strength Re, which relates to the characteristic, minimum and maximum 
values based on the long-term quality level of production. In contrast fYk is the characteristic yield stress based 
on only that reinforcement used in a particular structure. There is no direct relationship between fYk and the 
characteristic However the methods of evaluation and verification of yield strength given in EN 10080 
provide a sufficient check for obtaining fyk. 
(5) The application rules relating to lattice girders (see EN 10080 for definition) apply only to 
those made with ribbed bars. Lattice girders made with other types of reinforcement may be 
given in an appropriate European Technical Approval. 
3.2.2 Properties 
(1)P The behaviour of reinforcing steel is specified by the following properties:

Note 1: The properties of reinforcement required for use with this Eurocode are given in Annex C. 
Note 2: The properties and rules for the use of indented bars with precast concrete products may be found in 
the relevant product standard. 
(3)P The application rules for design and detailing in this Eurocode are valid for a specified 
yield strength range, fyk = 400 to 600 MPa. 
Note: The upper limit of fyk within this range for use within a Country may be found in its National Annex. 
(4)P The surface characteristics of ribbed bars shall be such to ensure adequate bond with the 
concrete. 
(5) Adequate bond may be assumed by cOrTlpliance with the specification of projected rib area, 
fRo 
Note: Minimum values of the relative rib area, fR' are given in the Annex C. 
(6)P The reinforcement shall have adequate bendability to allow the use of the minimum 
mandrel diameters specified in Table 8.1 and to allow rebending to be carried out. 
Note: For bend and rebend requirements see Annex C. 
3.2.3 Strength 
(1)P The yield strength fyk (or the 0,2¬∞/0 proof stress, fO,2k) and the tensile strength ftk are defined 
respectively as the characteristic value of the yield load, and the characteristic maximum load in 
direct axial tension, each divided by the nominal cross sectional area. 
3.2.4 Ductility characteristics

sufficient to resist the design forces. 
(4) The strength of the welded joints of welded fabric may be assumed to be adequate if each 
welded joint can withstand a shearing force not less than 25% of a force equivalent to the 
specified characteristic yield stress times the nominal cross sectional area. This force should 
be based on the area of the thicker wire if the two are different.

design values derived from the characteristic values given in 3.2.2. 
(2) For normal design, either of the following assumptions may be made (see Figure 3.8): 
~a) an inclined top branch with a strain limit of Sud and a maximum stress of kfyk/Ys at Suk, 
where k = (ftlfy)k' 
b) a horizontal top branch without the need to check the strain limit.

(4) The design value of the modulus of elasticity, Es may be assumed to be 200 GPa. 
3.3 Prestressing steel 
3.3.1 General 
(1)P This clause applies to wires, bars and strands used as prestressing tendons in concrete 
structures. 
(2)P Prestressing tendons shall have an acceptably low level of susceptibility to stress 
corrosion. 
(3) The level of susceptibility to stress corrosion may be assumed to be acceptably low if the 
prestressing tendons comply with the criteria specified in EN 10138 or given in an appropriate 
European Technical Approval. 
(4) The requirements for the properties of the prestressing tendons are for the materials as 
placed in their final position in the structure. Where the methods of production, testing and 
attestation of conformity for prestressing tendons are in accordance with EN 10138 or given in 
an appropriate European Technical Approval it may be assumed that the requirements of this 
Eurocode are met. 
(5)P For steels complying with this Eurocode, tensile strength, 0,1% proof stress, and 
elongation at maximum load are specified in terms of characteristic values; these values are 
designated respectively fpk' fpO,1k and Euk. 
Note: EN 10138 refers to the characteristic, minimum and maximum values based on the long-term quality 
level of production. In contrast fpO,1k and fpk are the characteristic proof stress and tensile strength based on 
only that prestressing steel required for the structure. There is no direct relationship between the two sets of 
values. However the characteristic values for 0,1 % proof force, FpO,1k divided by the cross-section area, Sn 
given in EN 10 138 together with the methods for evaluation and verification provide a sufficient check for 
obtaining the value of fpO,1k' 
(6) Where other steels are used, which are not in accordance with EN 10138, the properties 
may be given in an appropriate European Technical Approval. 
(7)P Each product shall be clearly identifiable with respect to the classification system in 3.3.2 
(2)P. 
(8)P The prestressing tendons shall be classified for relaxation purposes according to 
3.3.2 (4)P or given in an appropriate European Technical Approval. 
(9)P Each consignment shall be accompanied by a certificate containing all the information 
necessary for its identification with regard to (i) -(iv) in 3.3.2 (2)P and additional information 
where necessary. 
(10)P There shall be no welds in wires and bars. Individual wires of strands may contain 
staggered welds made only before cold drawing. 
(11)P For coiled prestressing tendons, after uncoiling a length of wire or strand the maximum 
bow height shall comply with EN 10138 unless given in an appropriate European Technical 
Approval.

3.3.2 Properties 
(1)P The properties of prestressing steel are given in EN 10138, Parts 2 to 4 or European 
Technical Approval. 
(2)P The prestressing tendons (wires, strands and bars) shall be classified according to: 
(i) Strength, denoting the value of the 0,1 % proof stress (fpO,1k) and the value of the ratio of 
tensile strength to proof strength (fpk Ifpo,1k) and elongation at maximum load (8uk) 
(ii) Class, indicating the relaxation behaviour 
(iii) Size 
(iv) Surface characteristics. 
(3)P The actual mass of the prestressing tendons shall not differ from the nominal mass by 
more than the limits specified in EN 10138 or given in an appropriate European Technical 
Approval. 
(4)P In this Eurocode, three classes of relaxation are defined: 
Class 1: wire or strand -ordinary relaxation 
Class 2: wire or strand -low relaxation 
Class 3: hot rolled and processed bars 
Note: Class 1 is not covered by EN 10138. 
(5) The design calculations for the losses due to relaxation of the prestressing steel should be 
based on the value of P1000, the relaxation loss (in 0/0) at 1000 hours after tensioning and at a 
mean temperature of 20 DC (see EN 10138 for the definition of the isothermal relaxation test). 
Note: The value of P1000 is expressed as a percentage ratio of the initial stress and is obtained for an initial 
stress equal to 0,7fp. where fp is the actual tensile strength of the prestressing steel samples. For design 
calculations, the characteristic tensile strength (fpk) is used and this has been taken into account in the following 
expressions. 
(6) The values for P1000 can be either assumed equal to 80/0 for Class 1 J 2,5% for Class 2, and 
4% for Class 3, or taken from the certificate. 
(7) The relaxation loss may be obtained fron1 the manufacturers test certificates or defined as 
the percentage ratio of the variation of the prestressing stress over the initial prestressing 
stress, should be determined by applying one of the Expressions below. Expressions (3.28) 
and (3.29) apply for wires or strands for ordinary prestressing and low relaxation tendons 
respectively, whereas Expression (3.30) applies for hot rolled and processed bars.

P1000 is the value of relaxation loss (in 0/0), at 1000 hours after tensioning and at a mean 
temperature of 20aC. 
Note: Where the relaxation losses are calculated for different time intervals (stages) and greater accuracy is 
required, reference should be made to Annex D. 
(8) The long term (final) values of the relaxation losses may be estimated for a time t equal to 
500 000 hours (i.e. around 57 years). 
(9) Relaxation losses are very sensitive to the temperature of the steel. Where heat treatment 
~is applied (e.g. by steam), 10.3.2.1 applies. Otherwise where this temperature is greater than 
50aC the relaxation losses should be verified. 
3.3.3 Strength 
(1)P The 0,10/0 proof stress (fpO,1k ) and the specified value of the tensile strength (fpk ) are 
defined as the characteristic value of the 0,10/0 proof load and the characteristic maximum load 
in axial tension respectively, divided by the nominal cross sectional area as shown in Figure

(2) Adequate ductility in elongation may be assumed if the prestressing tendons obtain the 
specified value of the elongation at maximum load given in EN 10138.

requirements for bendability of EN ISO 15630. 
(4) Stress-strain diagrams for the prestressing tendons, based on production data, shall be 
prepared and made available by the producer as an annex to the certificate accompanying the 
consignment (see 3.3.1 (9)P). 
(5) Adequate ductility in tension may be assumed for the prestressing tendons if fpk /fpo,1k ~ k. 
Note: The value of k for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The recommended value is 1,1. 
3.3.5 Fatigue 
(1)P Prestressing tendons shall have adequate fatigue strength. 
(2)P The fatigue stress range for prestressing tendons shall be in accordance with EN 10138 
or given in an appropriate European Technical Approval. 
3.3.6 Design assumptions 
(1)P Structural analysis is performed on the basis of the notTlinal cross-section area of the 
prestressing steel and the characteristic values fpO,1k' fpk and Euk. 
(2) The design value for the modulus of elasticity, Ep may be assumed equal to 205 GPa for 
wires and bars. The actual value can range from 195 to 210 GPa, depending on the 
manufacturing process. Certificates accompanying the consignment should give the 
appropriate value. 
(3) The design value for the modulus of elasticity, Ep may be assumed equal to 195 GPa for 
strand. The actual value can range from 185 GPa to 205 GPa, depending on the manufacturing 
process. Certificates accotTlpanying the consignment should give the appropriate value. 
(4) The mean density of prestressing tendons for the purposes of design may normally be 
taken as 7850 kg/m3 
(5) The values given above may be assumed to be valid within a temperature range between 
-40¬∞C and +1 OO¬∞C for the prestressing steel in the finished structure. 
(6) The design value for the steel stress, fpd, is taken as fpo,'lk/rs (see Figure 3.10). 
(7) For cross-section design, either of the following assumptions may be made (see Figure 
3.10): 
44 -an inclined branch, with a strain limit cud. The design may also be based on the actual 
stress/strain relationship, if this is known, with stress above the elastic limit reduced 
analogously with Figure 3.10, or 
- a horizontal top branch without strain limit. 
Note: The value of c'ud for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The recommended value is 
0,9cuk. If more accurate values are not known the recommended values are Cud = 0,02 and fpO,1k/fpk = 0,9.

SECTION 4 DURABILITY AND COVER TO REINFORCEMENT 
4.1 General 
(1)P A durable structure shall meet the requirements of serviceability, strength and stability 
throughout its design working life, without significant loss of utility or excessive unforeseen 
maintenance (for general requirements see also EN 1990). 
(2)P The required protection of the structure shall be established by considering its intended 
use, design working life (see EN 1990), maintenance programme and actions. 
(3)P The possible significance of direct and indirect actions, environmental conditions (4.2) and 
consequential effects shall be considered. 
Note: Examples include deformations due to creep and shrinkage (see 2.3.2). 
(4) Corrosion protection of steel reinforcement depends on density, quality and thickness of 
concrete cover (see 4.4) and cracking (see 7.3). The cover density and quality is achieved by 
controlling the maximum water/cement ratio and minimum cement content (see EN 206-1) and 
may be related to a minimum strength class of concrete. 
Note: Further information is given in Annex E. 
(5) Where metal fastenings are inspectable and replaceable, they may be used with protective 
coatings in exposed situations. Otherwise, they should be of corrosion resistant material. 
(6) Further requirements to those given in this Section should be considered for special 
situations (e.g. for structures of temporary or monumental nature, structures subjected to 
extreme or unusual actions etc.). 
4.2 Environmental conditions 
(1)P Exposure conditions are chemical and physical conditions to which the structure is 
exposed in addition to the mechanical actions. 
(2) Environmental conditions are classified according to Table 4.1, based on EN 206-1. 
(3) In addition to the conditions in Table 4.1, particular forms of aggressive or indirect action 
should be considered including: 
chemical attack, arising fron1 e.g. 
-the use of the building or the structure (storage of liquids, etc) 
-solutions of acids or sulfate salts (EN 206-1, ISO 9690) 
-chlorides contained in the concrete (EN 206-1) 
-alkali-aggregate reactions (EN 206-1, National Standards) 
physical attack, arising from e.g. 
-temperature change 
-abrasion (see 4.4.1.2 (13)) 
-water penetration (EN 206-1).

EN 1992-1-1:2004 (E) 
Note: The composition of the concrete affects both the protection of the reinforcement and the resistance of the 
concrete to attack. Annex E gives indicative strength classes for the particular environmental exposure classes. 
This may lead to the choice of higher strength classes than required for the structural design. In such cases 
the value of should be associated with the higher strength in the calculation of minimum reinforcement and 
crack width control (see 7.3.2 -7.3.4). 
4.3 Requirements for durability 
(1)P In order to achieve the required design working life of the structure, adequate n1easures 
shall be taken to protect each structural element against the relevant environmental actions. 
(2)P The requirements for durability shall be included when considering the following: 
Structural conception, 
Material selection, 
Construction details, 
Execution, 
Quality Control, 
Inspection, 
Verifications,

4.4 Methods of verification 
4.4.1 Concrete cover 
4.4.1.1 General

nearest concrete surface (including links and stirrups and surface reinforcement where 
relevant) and the nearest concrete surface. 
(2)P The nominal cover shall be specified on the drawings. It is defined as a minimum cover, 
Cmin (see 4.4.1.2), plus an allowance in design for deviation, ~Cdev (see 4.4.1.3): 
Cnom = Cmin + ~Cdev (4.1 ) 
4.4.1.2 Minimum cover, Cmin 
(1)P Minimum concrete cover, Cmin, shall be provided in order to ensure: 
the safe transmission of bond forces (see also Sections 7 and 8) 
the protection of the steel against corrosion (durability) 
an adequate fire resistance (see EN 1992-1-2) 
(2)P The greater value for Cmin satisfying the requirements for both bond and environmental 
conditions shall be used. 
Cmin = max {Cmin,b; Cmin,dur + ~Cdur;y -~Cdur,st -~Cdur,add; 10 mm} (4.2) 
where: 
Cmin,b minimum cover due to bond requirement, see 4.4.1.2 (3) 
Cmin,dur minimum cover due to environmental conditions, see 4.4.1.2 (5) 
~Cdur,y additive safety element, see 4.4.1.2 (6) 
~Cdur,st reduction of minimum cover for use of stainless steel, see 4.4.1.2 (7) 
~Cdur,add reduction of minimum cover for use of additional protection, see 4.4.1.2 (8)

(6) The concrete cover should be increased by the additive safety element b.Cdur,y. 
Note: The value of L\Cdur,y for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The recommended value is 
Omm. 
(7) Where stainless steel is used or where other special measures have been taken, the 
minimunl cover may be reduced by b.Cdur,st. For such situations the effects on all relevant 
material properties should be considered, including bond. 
Note: The value of L\Cdur,st for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The recommended value, 
without further specification, is 0 mm. 
(8) For concrete with additional protection (e.g. coating) the minimum cover may be reduced by 
b.Cdur ,add¬∑ 
Note: The value of L\Cdur,add for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The recommended value, 
without further specification, is 0 mm. 
(9) Where in-situ concrete is placed against other concrete elements (precast or in-situ) the 
minimum concrete cover of the reinforcement to the interface may be reduced to a value 
corresponding to the requirement for bond (see (3) above) provided that: 
the strength class of concrete is at least C25/30, 
the exposure tinle of the concrete surface to an outdoor environment is short ¬´ 28 days), 
-the interface has been roughened. 
(10) For unbonded tendons the cover should be provided in accordance with the European 
Technical Approval. 
(11) For uneven surfaces (e.g. exposed aggregate) the minimum cover should be increased by 
at least 5 mm. 
51 

=== PAGE 54 ===

BS EN 1992-1-1:2004 
EN 1992-1-1:2004 (E) 
(12) Where freeze/thaw or chelTlical attack on concrete (Classes XF and XA) is expected 
special attention should be given to the concrete composition (see EN 206-1 Section 6). Cover 
in accordance with 4.4 will normally be sufficient for such situations. 
(13) For concrete abrasion special attention should be given on the aggregate according to EN 
206-1. Optionally concrete abrasion may be allowed for by increasing the concrete cover 
(sacrificial layer). In that case the minimum cover Cmin should be increased by k1 for Abrasion 
Class XM 1, by k2 for XM2 and by k3 for XM3. 
Note: Abrasion Class XM1 means a moderate abrasion like for members of industrial sites frequented by 
vehicles with air tyres. Abrasion Class XM2 means a heavy abrasion like for members of industrial sites 
frequented by fork lifts with air or solid rubber tyres. Abrasion Class XM3 means an extreme abrasion like for 
members industrial sites frequented by fork lifts with elastomer or steel tyres or track vehicles. 
The values of k1' k2 and k3 for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The recommended values 
are 5 mm, 10 mm and 15 mm. 
4.4.1.3 Allowance in design for deviation 
(1)P To calculate the nOlTlinal cover, Cnom, an addition to the ITlinimum cover shall be made in 
design to allow for the deviation (L1Cdev). The required minimum cover shall be increased by the 
absolute value of the accepted negative deviation. 
Note: The value of L1Cdev for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The recommended value is 
10 mm. 
(2) For Buildings, ENV 13670-1 gives the acceptable deviation. This is normally also sufficient 
for other types of structures. It should be considered when choosing the value of nominal cover 
for design. The nominal value of cover for design should be used in the calculations and stated 
on the drawings, unless a value other than the nominal cover is specified (e.g. minimum value). 
(3) In certain situations, the accepted deviation and hence allowance, L1Cdev, may be reduced. 
Note: The reduction in ~Cdev in such circumstances for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. 
The recommended values are: 
-where fabrication is subjected to a quality assurance system, in which the monitoring includes 
measurements of the concrete cover, the allowance in design for deviation L1Cdcv may be reduced: 
10 mm 2 L1Cdev 5 mm (4.3N) 
-where it can be assured that a very accurate measurement device is used for monitoring and non 
conforming members are rejected (e.g. precast elements), the allowance in design for deviation L1Cdcv 
may be reduced: 
10 mm 2 L1Cdcv 20 mm (4.4N) 
~(4) For concrete cast against uneven surfaces, the nominal cover should generally be 
increased by allowing larger deviations in design. Tile increase should comply with the 
~difference caused by the unevenness, but the nonlinal cover should be at least k1 nlm for@il 
concrete cast against prepared ground (including blinding) and k2 mm for concrete cast directly 
against soil. The cover to the reinforcement for any surface feature, such as ribbed finishes or 
exposed aggregate, should also be increased to take account of the uneven surface (see 
4.4.1.2 (11)). 
52 Note: The values of k1 and k2 for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The recommended 
values are 40 mm and 75 mm.

EN 1992-1-1:2004 (E) 
SECTION 5 STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS 
5.1 General 
5.1.1 General requirements 
(1)P The purpose of structural analysis is to establish the distribution of either internal forces 
and moments, or stresses, strains and displacements, over the whole or part of a structure. 
Additional local analysis shall be carried out where necessary. 
Note: In most normal cases analysis will be used to establish the distribution of internal forces and moments, 
and the complete verification or demonstration of resistance of cross sections is based on these action effects; 
however, for certain particular elements, the methods of analysis used (e.g. finite element analysis) give 
stresses, strains and displacements rather than internal forces and moments. Special methods are required to 
use these results to obtain appropriate verification. 
(2) Local analyses may be necessary where the assumption of linear strain distribution is not 
valid, e.g.: 
in the vicinity of supports 
local to concentrated loads 
in beam-column intersections 
in anchorage zones 
at changes in cross section. 
(3) For in-plane stress fields a simplified method for determining reinforcement may be used. 
Note: A simplified method is given in Annex F. 
(4)P Analyses shall be carried out using idealisations of both the geometry and the behaviour 
of the structure. The idealisations selected shall be appropriate to the problem being 
considered. 
~ Clause deleted 
(5)P The effect of the geometry and properties of the structure on its behaviour at each stage 
of construction shall be considered in the design 
(6) Common idealisations of the behaviour used for analysis are: 
linear elastic behaviour (see 5.4) 
linear elastic behaviour with lin-dted redistribution (see 5.5) 
plastic behaviour (see 5.6), including strut and tie models (see 5.6.4) 
non-linear behaviour (see 5.7) 
(7) In buildings, the effects of shear and axial forces on the deformations of linear elements 
and slabs may be ignored where these are likely to be less than 100/0 of those due to 
bending. 
5.1.2 Special requirements for foundations 
(1)P Where ground-structure interaction has significant influence on the action effects in the 
structure, the properties of the soil and the effects of the interaction shall be taken into 
account in accordance with EN 1997-1. 
Note: For more information concerning the analysis of shallow foundations see Annex G. 
53 

=== PAGE 56 ===

BS EN 1992-1-1:2004 
EN 1992-1-1:2004 (E) 
(2) For the design of spread foundations, appropriately simplified models for the description of 
the soil-structure interaction may be used. 
Note: For simple pad footings and pile caps the effects of soil-structure interaction may usually be ignored. 
(3) For the strength design of individual piles the actions should be determined taking into 
account the interaction between the piles, the pile cap and the supporting soil. 
(4) Where the piles are located in several rows, the action on each pile should be evaluated by 
considering the interaction between the piles. 
(5) This interaction may be ignored when the clear distance between the piles is greater than 
two times the pile diameter. 
5.1.3 Load cases and combinations 
(1)P In considering the combinations of actions, see EN 1990 Section 6, the relevant cases 
shall be considered to enable the critical design conditions to be established at all sections, 
within the structure or part of the structure considered. 
Note: Where a simplification in the number of load arrangements for use in a Country is required, reference is 
made to its National Annex. The following simplified load arrangements are recommended for buildings: 
(a) alternate spans carrying the design variable and permanent load (YOOk + yGGk+ Pm), other spans carrying 
only the design permanent load, yGGk + Pm and 
(b) any two adjacent spans carrying the design variable and permanent loads (YOOk + yGGk+ Pm). All other 
spans carrying only the design permanent load, yGGk+ Pm . 
5.1.4 Second order effects 
(1)P Second order effects (see EN 1990 Section 1) shall be taken into account where they are 
likely to affect the overall stability of a structure significantly and for the attainment of the 
ultimate limit state at critical sections. 
(2) Second order effects should be taken into account according to 5.8. 
(3) For buildings, second order effects below certain limits may be ignored (see 5.8.2 (6)). 
5.2 Geometric imperfections 
(1)P The unfavourable effects of possible deviations in the geometry of the structure and the 
position of loads shall be taken into account in the analysis of members and structures. 
Note: Deviations in cross section dimensions are normally taken into account in the material safety factors. 
These should not be included in structural analysis. A minimum eccentricity for cross section design is given 
in 6.1 (4). 
(2)P Imperfections shall be taken into account in ultimate limit states in persistent and 
accidental design situations. 
(3) Imperfections need not be considered for serviceability limit states. 
(4) The following provisions apply for members with axial cOITlpression and structures with 
vertical load, mainly in buildings. Numerical values are related to normal execution deviations 
54 

=== PAGE 57 ===

BS EN 1992-1-1:2004 
EN 1992-1-1:2004 (E) 
(Class 1 in ENV 13670). With the use of other deviations (e.g. Class 2), values should be 
adjusted accordingly. 
(5) Imperfections may be represented by an inclination, ~,given by: 
(S.1 ) 
where 
tt is the basic value: 
ah is the reduction factor for length or height: 
am is the reduction factor for number of members: 
IE.]) / is the length or height [m], see (6) @j] ah = 21.fi; 2/3 ah S 1 
am = ~0,S(1+1/m) 
m is the number of vertical members contributing to the total effect 
Note: The value of 00 for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The recommended value is 
1/200 
(6) In Expression (5.1), the definition of / and m depends on the effect considered, for which 
three main cases can be distinguished (see also Figure 5.1): 
-Effect on isolated member: / = actual length of member, m =1. 
-Effect on bracing system: / = height of building, m = number of vertical members 
contributing to the horizontal force on the bracing system. 
-Effect on floor or roof diaphragms distributing the horizontal loads: / = storey height, 
m = number of vertical elements in the storey(s) contributing to the total horizontal force on 
the floor. 
(7) For isolated members (see S.8.1), the effect of imperfections may be taken into account in 
two alternative ways a) or b): 
a) as an eccentricity, ej, given by 
(5.2) 
where /0 is the effective length, see 5.8.3.2 
For walls and isolated columns in braced systenls, ej = /0/400 may always be used as a 
simplification, corresponding to ah = 1. 
b) as a transverse force, Hi! in the position that gives maximum moment: 
for unbraced menlbers (see Figure 5.1 a1): 
Hi = ~N (S.3a) 
for braced members (see Figure 5.1 a2): 
Hi = 2~N (5.3b) 
where N is the axial load 
Note: Eccentricity is suitable for statically determinate members, whereas transverse load can be used for 
both determinate and indeterminate members. The force Hi may be substituted by some other equivalent 
transverse action.

included in the analysis together with other actions.

EN 1992-1-1:2004 (E) 
5.3 Idealisation of the structure 
5.3.1 Structural models for overall analysis 
(1)P The elements of a structure are classified, by consideration of their nature and function, as 
beams, columns, slabs, walls, plates, arches, shells etc. Rules are provided for the analysis of 
the commoner of these elements and of structures consisting of combinations of these 
elenlents. 
(2) For buildings the following provisions (3) to (7) are applicable: 
(3) A beam is a member for which the span is not less than 3 times the overall section depth. 
Otherwise it should be considered as a deep beam. 
(4) A slab is a member for which the minimum panel dimension is not less than 5 times the 
overall slab thickness. 
(5) A slab subjected to dorninantly uniformly distributed loads may be considered to be one¬≠
way spanning if either: 
-it possesses two free (unsupported) and sensibly parallel edges, or 
-it is the central part of a sensibly rectangular slab supported on four edges with a ratio of 
the longer to shorter span greater than 2. 
(6) Ribbed or waffle slabs need not be treated as discrete elements for the purposes of 
analysis, provided that the flange or structural topping and transverse ribs have sufficient 
torsional stiffness. This may be assumed provided that: 
-the rib spacing does not exceed 1500 mm 
-the depth of the rib below the flange does not exceed 4 times its width. 
-the depth of the flange is at least 1/10 of the clear distance between ribs or 50 mm, 
whichever is the greater. 
-transverse ribs are provided at a clear spacing not exceeding 10 times the overall depth of 
the slab. 
The minimum flange thickness of 50 mm may be reduced to 40 mm where permanent blocks 
are incorporated between the ribs. 
(7) A column is a member for which the section depth does not exceed 4 times its width and 
the height is at least 3 times the section depth. Otherwise it should be considered as a wall. 
5.3.2 Geometric data 
5.3.2.1 Effective width of flanges (all limit states) 
(1)P In T beams the effective flange width, over which uniform conditions of stress can be 
assumed, depends on the web and flange dimensions, the type of loading, the span, the 
support conditions and the transverse reinforcement. 
(2) The effective width of flange should be based on the distance 10 between points of zero 
monlent, which may be obtained from Figure 5.2.

(4) For structural analysis, where a great accuracy is not required, a constant width may be 
assumed over the whole span. The value applicable to the span section should be adopted. 
5.3.2.2 Effective span of beams and slabs in buildings 
Note: The following provisions are provided mainly for member analysis. For frame analysis some of these 
simplifications may be used where appropriate. 
(1) The effective span, leff' of a member should be calculated as follows:

where: 
In is the clear distance between the faces of the supports; 
values for 81 and 82 ' at each end of the span, may be determined from the appropriate 8j 
values in Figure 5.4 where t is the width of the supporting element as shown.

(2) Continuous slabs and beams may generally be analysed on the assumption that the 
supports provide no rotational restraint. 
(3) Where a beam or slab is monolithic with its supports, the critical design moment at the 
support should be taken as that at the face of the support. The design moment and reaction 
transferred to the supporting element (e.g. column, wall, etc.) should be generally taken as the 
greater of the elastic or redistributed values. 
Note: The moment at the face of the support should not be less than 0,65 that of the full fixed end moment.

EN 1992-1-1:2004 (E) 
(4) Regardless of the method of analysis used, where a beam or slab is continuous over a 
support which may be considered to provide no restraint to rotation (e.g. over walls), the design 
support moment, calculated on the basis of a span equal to the centre-to-centre distance 
between supports, may be reduced by an amount I1MEd as follows: 
I1MEd = FEd,5UP tI 8 
where: 
FEd,sup is the design support reaction 
t is the breadth of the support (see Figure 5.4 b)) 
Note: Where support bearings are used t should be taken as the bearing width. 
5.4 Linear elastic analysis 
(1) Linear analysis of elements based on the theory of elasticity may be used for both the 
serviceability and ultimate limit states. (5.9) 
(2) For the determination of the action effects, linear analysis may be carried out assuming: 
i) uncracked cross sections, 
ii) linear stress-strain relationships and 
iii) mean value of the modulus of elasticity. 
(3) For thernlal deformation, settlenlent and shrinkage effects at the ultimate limit state (ULS), 
a reduced stiffness corresponding to the cracked sections, neglecting tension stiffening but 
including the effects of creep, may be assumed. For the serviceability linlit state (SLS) a 
gradual evolution of cracking should be considered. 
5.5 Linear elastic analysis with limited redistribution 
(1)P The influence of any redistribution of the moments on all aspects of the design shall be 
considered. 
(2) Linear analysis with limited redistribution may be applied to the analysis of structural 
members for the verification of ULS. 
(3) The moments at ULS calculated using a linear elastic analysis may be redistributed, 
provided that the resulting distribution of monlents remains in equilibrium with the applied loads. 
(4) In continuous beams or slabs which: 
a) are predominantly subject to flexure and 
b) have the ratio of the lengths of adjacent spans in the range of 0,5 to 2, 
redistribution of bending moments may be carried out without explicit check on the rotation 
capacity, provided that: 
60 5 k1 + k2Xu/d for fck :::; 50 MPa 
5 ~ k3 + k4Xufd for fck > 50 MPa 
k5 where Class B and Class C reinforcement is used (see Annex C) 
~ k6 where Class A reinforcement is used (see Annex C) 
Where: 
5 is the ratio of the redistributed moment to the elastic bending moment 
Xu is the depth of the neutral axis at the ultimate limit state after redistribution (5.10a) 
(5.10b) 

=== PAGE 63 ===

EN 1992-1-1:2004 (E) 
d is the effective depth of the section 
Note: The values of kl, k2, k3, k4, k5 and kG for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The 
recommended value for k1 is 0,44, for k2 is 1 ,25(0,6+0,0014!&cu2), for k3 = 0,54, for k4 = 1 ,25(0,6+0,0014/s cu2), for 
k5 = 0,7 and k6 = 0,8. &cu2 is the ultimate strain according to Table 3.1. 
(5) Redistribution should not be carried out in circumstances where the rotation capacity cannot 
be defined with confidence (e.g. in the corners of prestressed frames). 
(6) For the design of coilJITlns the elastic moments from frame action should be used without 
any redistribution. 
5.6 Plastic analysis 
5.6.1 General 
(1)P Methods based on plastic analysis shall only be used for the check at ULS. 
(2)P The ductility of the critical sections shall be sufficient for the envisaged mechanism to be 
formed. 
(3)P The plastic analysis should be based either on the lower bound (static) method or on the 
upper bound (kinematic) method. 
Note: A Country's National Annex Guidance may refer to non-contradictory complementary information. 
(4) The effects of previous applications of loading may generally be ignored, and a monotonic 
increase of the intensity of actions may be assumed. 
5.6.2 Plastic analysis for beams, frames and slabs 
(1)P Plastic analysis without any direct check of rotation capacity may be used for the ultimate 
liITlit state if the conditions of 5.6.1 (2)P are met. 
(2) The required ductility may be deemed to be satisfied without explicit verification if all the 
following are fulfilled: 
i) the area of tensile reinforcement is limited such that, at any section 
xuld :::; 0,25 for concrete strength classes:::; C50/60 
xuld :::; 0,15 for concrete strength classes ~ C55/67 
ii) reinforcing steel is either Class B or C 
iii) the ratio of the moments at intermediate supports to the moments in the span should be 
between 0,5 and 2. 
(3) Columns should be checked for the maximum plastic moments which can be transmitted by 
connecting menlbers. For connections to flat slabs this moment should be included in the 
punching shear calculation. 
(4) When plastic analysis of slabs is carried out account should be taken of any non-uniform 
reinforcement, corner tie down forces, and torsion at free edges. 
(5) Plastic methods may be extended to non-solid slabs (ribbed, hollow, waffle slabs) if their 
response is similar to that of a solid slab, particularly with regard to the torsional effects.

5.6.3 Rotation capacity 
(1) The simplified procedure for continuous beams and continuous one way spanning slabs is 
based on the rotation capacity of beam/slab zones over a length of approximately 1,2 times the 
depth of section. It is assumed that these zones undergo a plastic deformation (formation of 
yield hinges) under the relevant combination of actions. The verification of the plastic rotation in 
the ultimate limit state is considered to be fulfilled, if it is shown that under the relevant 
combination of actions the calculated rotation, Bs, is less than or equal to the allowable plastic 
rotation (see Figure 5.5).

~ (2) In region of yield hinges, xufd should not exceed the value 0,45 for concrete strength classes 
less than or equal to C50/60, and 0,35 for concrete strength classes greater than or equal to 
C55/67. @11 
~ (3) The rotation es should be determined on the basis of the design values for actions and of 
mean values for materials and for prestressing at the relevant time. @it 
(4) In the simplified procedure, the allowable plastic rotation may be determined by multiplying 
the basic value of allowable rotation, Bpl,d, by a correction factor kA that depends on the shear 
slenderness. 
62 Note: Values of Bpl,d for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The recommended values for 
steel Classes Band C (the use of Class A steel is not recommended for plastic analysis) and concrete 
strength classes less than or equal to C50/60 and C90/105 are given in Figure 5.6N. 
The values for concrete strength classes C 55/67 to C 90/105 may be interpolated accordingly. The values 
apply for a shear slenderness A = 3,0. For different values of shear slenderness Bpl,d should be multiplied by 
k~.: 
(5.11N) 
Where A is the ratio of the distance between point of zero and maximum moment after redistribution and 
effective depth, d. 
As a simplification A may be calculated for the concordant design values of the bending moment and shear:

5.6.4 Analysis with strut and tie models 
(1) Strut and tie models may be used for design in ULS of continuity regions (cracked state of 
beams and slabs, see 6.1 -6.4) and for the design in ULS and detailing of discontinuity regions 
(see 6.5). In general these extend up to a distance h (section depth of member) from the 
discontinuity. Strut and tie models may also be used for members where a linear distribution 
within the cross section is assumed, e.g. plane strain. 
(2) Verifications in SLS may also be carried out using strut-and-tie models, e.g. verification of 
steel stresses and crack width control, if approxin1ate compatibility for strut-and-tie models is 
ensured (in particular the position and direction of important struts should be oriented according 
to linear elasticity theory) 
(3) Strut-and-tie models consist of struts representing corrlpressive stress fields, of ties 
representing the reinforcement, and of the connecting nodes. The forces in the elements of a 
strut-and-tie model should be determined by maintaining the equilibrium with the applied loads 
in the ultimate limit state. The elements of strut-and-tie models should be dimensioned 
according to the rules given in 6.5. 
(4) The ties of a strut-and-tie model should coincide in position and direction with the 
corresponding reinforcement. 
(5) Possible means for developing suitable strut-and-tie models include the adoption of stress 
trajectories and distributions from linear-elastic theory or the load path method. All strut-and-tie 
models may be optin1ised by energy criteria. 
5.7 Non-linear analysis 
(1) Non-linear methods of analysis may be used for both ULS and SLS, provided that 
equilibrium and compatibility are satisfied and an adequate non-linear behaviour for materials is 
assumed. The analysis may be first or second order. 
63 

=== PAGE 66 ===

BS EN 1992-1-1:2004 
EN 1992-1-1:2004 (E) 
(2) At the ultimate limit state, the ability of local critical sections to withstand any inelastic 
deformations implied by the analysis should be checked, taking appropriate account of 
uncertainties. 
(3) For structures predominantly subjected to static loads, the effects of previous applications 
of loading may generally be ignored, and a monotonic increase of the intensity of the actions 
may be assumed. 
(4)P The use of material characteristics which represent the stiffness in a realistic way but take 
account of the uncertainties of failure shall be used when using non-linear analysis. Only those 
design formats which are valid within the relevant fields of application shall be used. 
(5) For slender structures, in which second order effects cannot be ignored, the design method 
given in 5.B.6 may be used. 
5.8 Analysis of second order effects with axial load 
5.8.1 Definitions 
64 Biaxial bending: simultaneous bending about two prinCipal axes 
Braced members or systems: structural members or subsystems, which in analysis and 
design are assumed not to contribute to the overall horizontal stability of a structure 
Bracing members or systems: structural members or subsystems, which in analysis and 
design are assumed to contribute to the overall horizontal stability of a structure 
Buckling: failure due to instability of a member or structure under perfectly axial compression 
and without transverse load 
Note. "Pure buckling" as defined above is not a relevant limit state in real structures, due to imperfections and 
transverse loads, but a nominal buckling load can be used as a parameter in some methods for second order 
analysis. 
Buckling load: the load at which buckling occurs; for isolated elastic members it is 
synonymous with the Euler load 
Effective length: a length used to account for the shape of the deflection curve; it can also 
be defined as buckling length, i.e. the length of a pin-ended column with constant normal 
force, having the same cross section and buckling load as the actual member 
First order effects: action effects calculated without consideration of the effect of structural 
deformations, but including geometric imperfections 
Isolated members: members that are isolated, or members in a structure that for design 
purposes may be treated as being isolated; examples of isolated members with different 
boundary conditions are shown in Figure 5.7. 
Nominal second order moment: a second order moment used in certain design methods, 
giving a total moment compatible with the ultimate cross section resistance (see 5.B.5 (2)) 
Second order effects: additional action effects caused by structural deformations

EN 1992-1-1:2004 (E) 
5.8.2 General 
(1)P This clause deals with members and structures in which the structural behaviour is 
significantly influenced by second order effects (e.g. columns, walls, piles, arches and shells). 
Global second order effects are likely to occur in structures with a flexible bracing system. 
(2)P Where second order effects are taken into account, see (6), equilibrium and resistance 
shall be verified in the deformed state. Deformations shall be calculated taking into account the 
relevant effects of cracking, non-linear material properties and creep. 
Note. In an analysis assuming linear material properties, this can be taken into account by means of reduced 
stiffness values, see 5.8.7. 
(3)P Where relevant, analysis shall include the effect of flexibility of adjacent members and 
foundations (soil-structure interaction). 
(4)P The structural behaviour shall be considered in the direction in which deformations can 
occur, and biaxial bending shall be taken into account when necessary. 
(5)P Uncertainties in geometry and position of axial loads shall be taken into account as 
additional first order effects based on geometric imperfections, see 5.2. 
(6) Second order effects may be ignored if they are less than 10 % of the corresponding first 
order effects. Simplified criteria are given for isolated members in 5.8.3.1 and for structures in 
5.8.3.3. 
5.8.3 Simplified criteria for second order effects 
5.8.3.1 Slenderness criterion for isolated members 
(1) As an alternative to 5.8.2 (6), second order effects may be ignored if the slenderness A (as 
defined in 5.8.3.2) is below a certain value }qim. 
Note: The value of Alim for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The recommended value 
follows from: 
l4im = 20¬∑A¬∑a.C/~n (5.13N) 
where: 
A = 11 (1+0,2lfJef) (if lfJef is not known, A = 0,7 may be used) 
B = Jl + 2m (if (J) is not known, B = 1,1 may be used) 
C = 1,7 -rm (if rm is not known, C = 0,7 may be used) 
lfJef effective creep ratio; see 5.8.4; 
(I) = A/yd 1 (Acted); mechanical reinforcement ratio; 
As is the total area of longitudinal reinforcement 
n = NEd 1 (Acfcd); relative normal force 
rm = M01/Mo2; moment ratio 
M01, M02 are the first order end moments, I M021 I M01 I 
If the end moments M01 and M02 give tension on the same side, rm should be taken positive (i.e. C 1,7), 
otherwise negative (Le. C > 1,7). 
In the following cases, rm should be taken as 1,0 (i.e. C = 0,7): 
-for braced members in which the first order moments arise only from or predominantly due to imperfections 
or transverse loading 
-for unbraced members in general 
65 

=== PAGE 68 ===

BS EN 1992-1-1:2004 
EN 1992-1-1:2004 (E) 
(2) In cases with biaxial bending, the slenderness criterion may be checked separately for each 
direction. Depending on the outcome of this check, second order effects (a) may be ignored in 
both directions, (b) should be taken into account in one direction, or (c) should be taken into 
account in both directions. 
5.8.3.2 Slenderness and effective length of isolated members 
(1) The slenderness ratio is defined as follows: 
/L = 10 / i 
where: 
10 is the effective length, see 5.8.3.2 (2) to (7) 
is the radius of gyration of the uncracked concrete section (5.14 ) 
(2) For a general definition of the effective length, see 5.8.1. Examples of effective length for 
isolated members with constant cross section are given in Figure 5.7.

lengths for isolated members 
(3) For compression members in regular frames, the slenderness criterion (see 5.8.3.1) should 
be checked with an effective length 10 determined in the following way:

BS EN 1992-1-1:2004 
EN 1992-1-1:2004 (E) 
k = (e/M)¬∑(EI/I) 
() is the rotation of restraining members for bending moment M; 
see also Figure 5.7 (f) and (g) 
EI is the bending stiffness of compression member, see also 5.8.3.2 (4) and (5) 
1 is the clear height of compression member between end restraints 
Note: k = 0 is the theoretical limit for rigid rotational restraint, and k = 00 represents the limit for no restraint at 
all. Since fully rigid restraint is rare in practise, a minimum value of 0,1 is recommended for k1 and k2. 
(4) If an adjacent compression member (colurnn) in a node is likely to contribute to the rotation 
at buckling, then (EIII) in the definition of k should be replaced by [(EI/ l)a+(EI/ I)b], a and b 
representing the compression member (column) above and below the node. 
(5) In the definition of effective lengths, the stiffness of restraining members should include the 
effect of cracking, unless they can be shown to be uncracked in ULS. 
(6) For other cases than those in (2) and (3), e.g. members with varying normal force and/or 
cross section, the criterion in 5.8.3.1 should be checked with an effective length based on the 
buckling load (calculated e.g. by a numerical method): 
(5.17) 
where: 
El is a representative bending stiffness 
Ns is buckling load expressed in terms of this E1 
(in Expression (5.14), i should also correspond to this E1) 
(7) The restraining effect of transverse walls may be allowed for in the calculation of the 
effective length of walls by the factor p given in 12.6.5.1. In Expression (12.9) and Table 12.1, Iw 
is then substituted by 10 determined according to 5.8.3.2. 
5.8.3.3 Global second order effects in buildings 
(1) As an alternative to 5.8.2 (6), global second order effects in buildings may be ignored if 
F < k .--=---
V,Ed - 1 ns + 1 ,6 (5.18) 
where: 
FV,Ed is the total vertical load (on braced and bracing members) 
ns is the number of storeys 
L is the total height of building above level of moment restraint 
Ecd is the design value of the modulus of elasticity of concrete, see 5.8.6 (3) 
Ie is the second moment of area (uncracked concrete section) of bracing member(s) 
Note: The value of k1 for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The recommended value is 
0,31. 
Expression (5.18) is valid only if all the following conditions are met: 
-torsional instability is not governing, i.e. structure is reasonably symmetrical 
-global shear deformations are negligible (as in a bracing system mainly consisting of shear 
walls without large openings) 
-bracing members are rigidly fixed at the base, i.e. rotations are negligible 
67 

=== PAGE 70 ===

BS EN 1992-1-1:2004 
EN 1992-1-1:2004 (E) 
-the stiffness of bracing members is reasonably constant along the height 
-the total vertical load increases by approxinlately the same amount per storey 
(2) k1 in Expression (5.18) may be replaced by k2 if it can be verified that bracing members 
are uncracked in ultinlate limit state. 
Note 1: The value of k2 for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The recommended value is 
0,62. 
Note 2: For cases where the bracing system has significant global shear deformations and/or end rotations, 
see Annex H (which also gives the background to the above rules). 
5.8.4 Creep 
(1)P The effect of creep shall be taken into account in second order analysis, with due 
consideration of both the general conditions for creep (see 3.1.4) and the duration of different 
loads in the load combination considered. 
(2) The duration of loads may be taken into account in a simplified way by means of an 
effective creep ratio, ({Jet, which, used together with the design load, gives a creep deformation 
(curvature) corresponding to the quasi-permanent load: 
({Jef = ({J(oo,tO) . MOEqp / MOEd 
where: 
({J(oo,tO) is the final creep coefficient according to 3.1.4 (5.19) 
MOEqp is the first order bending moment in quasi-permanent load combination (SLS) 
MOEd is the first order bending moment in design load combination (ULS) 
Note. It is also possible to base ((Jef on total bending moments MEqp and MEd, but this requires iteration and a 
verification of stability under quasi-permanent load with ((Jef = ((J(oo,tO). 
(3) If MOEqp / MOEd varies in a member or structure, the ratio may be calculated for the section 
with maximum moment, or a representative mean value may be used. 
(4) The effect of creep may be ignored, i.e. ({Jet = 0 may be assumed, if the following three 
conditions are met: 
({J (co,tO) ::; 2 
)~ ::; 75 
MOEd/ NEd 2:: h 
Here MOEd is the first order moment and h is the cross section depth in the corresponding 
direction. 
Note. If the conditions for neglecting second order effects according to 5.8.2 (6) or 5.8.3.3 are only just 
achieved, it may be too unconservative to neglect both second order effects and creep, unless the mechanical 
reinforcement ratio (w, see 5.8.3.1 (1)) is at least 0,25. 
5.8.5 Methods of analysis 
(1) The methods of analysis include a general method, based on non-linear second order 
analysis, see 5.8.6 and the following two simplified methods: 
68 (a) Method based on nominal stiffness, see 5.8.7 
(b) Method based on nominal curvature, see 5.8.8 

=== PAGE 71 ===

BS EN 1992-1-1:2004 
EN 1992-1-1:2004 (E) 
Note 1: The selection of Simplified Method (a) and (b) to be used in a Country may be found in its National 
Annex. 
Note 2: Nominal second order moments provided by the simplified methods (a) and (b) are sometimes 
greater than those corresponding to instability. This is to ensure that the total moment is compatible with the 
cross section resistance. 
(2) Method (a) may be used for both isolated members and whole structures, if nominal 
stiffness values are estimated appropriately; see 5.B.7. 
(3) Method (b) is mainly suitable for isolated members; see 5.B.B. However, with realistic 
assumptions concerning the distribution of curvature, the method in 5.B.B can also be used for 
structures. 
5.8.6 General method 
(1)P The general method is based on non-linear analysis, including geometric non-linearity i.e. 
second order effects. The general rules for non-linear analysis given in 5.7 apply. 
(2)P Stress-strain curves for concrete and steel suitable for overall analysis shall be used. The 
effect of creep shall be taken into account. 
(3) Stress-strain relationships for concrete and steel given in 3.1.5, Expressions (3.14) and 3.2.7 
(Figure 3.B) may be used. With stress-strain diagrams based on design values, a design value 
of the ultimate load is obtained directly from the analysis. In Expression (3.14), and in the k¬≠
value, fern is then substituted by the design compressive strength fed and Eem is substituted by 
= Eem (5.20) 
Note: The value of YCE for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The recommended value is 
1,2.@J] 
(4) In the absence of more refined models, creep may be taken into account by multiplying all 
strain values in the concrete stress-strain diagram according to 5.B.6 (3) with a factor (1 + lPef) , 
where lPef is the effective creep ratio according to 5.B.4. 
(5) The favourable effect of tension stiffening may be taken into account. 
Note: This effect is favourable, and may always be ignored, for simplicity. 
(6) Normally, conditions of equilibrium and strain compatibility are satisfied in a number of 
cross sections. A simplified alternative is to consider only the critical cross section(s), and to 
assume a relevant variation of the curvature in between, e.g. similar to the first order moment or 
simplified in another appropriate way. 
5.8.7 Method based on nominal stiffness 
5.8.7.1 General 
(1) In a second order analysis based on stiffness, nominal values of the flexural stiffness 
should be used, taking into account the effects of cracking, material non-linearity and creep on 
the overall behaviour. This also applies to adjacent members involved in the analysis, e.g. 
beams, slabs or foundations. Where relevant, soil-structure interaction should be taken into 
account.

(2) The resulting design moment is used for the design of cross sections with respect to 
~bending moment and axial force according to 6.1, as compared with 5.8.5 (1 ).@j] 
5.8.7.2 Nominal stiffness 
(1) The following model may be used to estimate the nominal stiffness of slender compression 
n1embers with arbitrary cross section: 
(5.21) 
where: 
Ecd is the design value of the modulus of elasticity of concrete, see 5.8.6 (3) 
Ie is the moment of inertia of concrete cross section 
is the design value of the modulus of elasticity of reinforcement, 5.8.6 (3) 
Is is the second moment of area of reinforcement, about the centre of area of the 
concrete 
Ke is a factor for effects of cracking, creep etc, see 5.8.7.2 (2) or (3) 
Ks is a factor for contribution of reinforcement, see 5.8.7.2 (2) or (3) 
(2) The following factors may be used in Expression (5.21), provided p :2: 0,002: 
Ks = 1 
Kc = k1k2 I (1 + <Pef) 
where: 
p is the geometric reinforcement ratio, AslAe 
As is the total area of reinforcement 
Ac is the area of concrete section 
<Pef is the effective creep ratio, see 5.8.4 
k1 is a factor which depends on concrete strength class, Expression (5.23) 
k2 is a factor which depends on axial force and slenderness, Expression (5.24) 
k1 = ~tCk /20 (MPa) 
/L k2 =n¬∑- sO 20 170 ' 
where: 
n is the relative axial force, NEd I (Acted) 
/L is the slenderness ratio, see 5.8.3 
If the slenderness ratio /L is not defined, k2 may be taken as 
k2 = n¬∑0,30 s 0,20 
(3) As a simplified alternative, provided p:2: 0,01, the following factors may be used in 
Expression (5.21): 
Ks 0 
Kc = 0,3 I (1 + 0,5rpef) (5.22) 
(5.23) 
(5.24 ) 
(5.25) 
(5.26) 
Note. The simplified alternative may be suitable as a preliminary step. followed by a more accurate calculation 
according to (2).

(4) In statically indeterminate structures, unfavourable effects of cracking in adjacent members 
should be taken into account. Expressions (5.21-5.26) are not generally applicable to such 
members. Partial cracking and tension stiffening may be taken into account e.g. according to 
7.4.3. However, as a simplification, fully cracked sections may be assumed. The stiffness 
should be based on an effective concrete modulus: 
Ecd,eff = Ecd/(1 + (,Oef) 
where: (5.27) 
is the design value of the modulus of elasticity according to 5.8.6 (3) 
(,Oef is the effective creep ratio; same value as for columns may be used 
5.8.7.3 Monlent magnification factor 
(1) The total design moment, including second order moment, nlay be expressed as a 
~ nlagnification of the bending moments resulting from a first order analysis, nanlely: 
(5.28) 
where: 
MOEd is the first order moment; see also 5.8.8.2 (2) 
P is a factor which depends on distribution of 1 st and 2nd order moments, see 5.8.7.3 
(2)-(3 ) 
NEd is the design value of axial load 
N8 is the buckling load based on norrlinal stiffness 
(2) For isolated members with constant cross section and axial load, the second order moment 
may nornlally be assumed to have a sine-shaped distribution. Then 
P = rc2 / Co (5.29) 
where: 
Co is a coefficient which depends on the distribution of first order moment (for instance, 
Co = 8 for a constant first order moment, Co = 9,6 for a parabolic and 12 for a 
symmetric triangular distribution etc.). 
(3) For members without transverse load, differing first order end moments M01 and M02 may 
be replaced by an equivalent constant first order moment Moe according to 5.8.8.2 (2). 
Consistent with the assumption of a constant first order moment, Co = 8 should be used. 
Note: The value of Co 8 also applies to members bent in double curvature. It should be noted that in some 
cases, depending on slenderness and axial force, the end moments(s) can be greater than the magnified 
equivalent moment 
(4) Where 5.8.7.3 (2) or (3) is not applicable, p = 1 is normally a reasonable simplification. 
Expression (5.28) can then be reduced to: 
(5.30)

Note: 5.B. 7.3 (4) is also applicable to the global analysis of certain types of structures, e.g. structures braced 
by shear walls and similar, where the principal action effect is bending moment in bracing units. For other 
types of structures, a more general approach is given in Annex H, Clause H.2. 
5.8.8 Method based on nominal curvature 
5.8.8.1 General 
(1) This method is primarily suitable for isolated members with constant normal force and a 
defined effective length fa (see 5.8.3.2). The method gives a nominal second order moment 
based on a deflection, which in turn is based on the effective length and an estimated maximum 
~ curvature (see also 5.8.5 (3)). @J] 
(2) The resulting design moment is used for the design of cross sections with respect to 
bending moment and axial force according to 6.1. 
5.8.8.2 Bending moments 
(1) The design moment is: 
where: (5.31) 
MOEd is the 15t order moment, including the effect of inlperfections, see also 5.8.8.2 (2) 
M2 is the nonlinal 2nd order monlent, see 5.8.8.2 (3) 
The maximum value of MEd is given by the distributions of MOEd and M2; the latter may be taken 
as parabolic or sinusoidal over the effective length. 
Note: For statically indeterminate members, MOEd is determined for the actual boundary conditions, whereas 
M2 will depend on boundary conditions via the effective length, ct. 5.8.8.1 (1). 
~ (2) For members without loads applied between their ends, differing first order end 
moments M01 and M02 may be replaced by an equivalent first order end moment MOe: @J] 
Moe = 0,6 M02 + 0,4 M01 2: 0,4 M02 
M01 and M02 should have the same si~n if they give tension on the same side, otherwise 
opposite signs. Furthermore, 1 M02I2: I M01 I. 
(3) The nominal second order moment M2 in Expression (5.31) is 
M2 = NEd e2 
where: 
NEd is the design value of axial force 
e2 is the deflection = (1 Ir) '02 / c 
11r is the curvature, see 5.8.8.3 
'0 is the effective length, see 5.8.3.2 
c is a factor depending on the curvature distribution, see 5.8.8.2 (4) (5.32) 
(5.33) 
(4) For constant cross section, C = 1 0 (~ rc2) is normally used. If the first order moment is 
constant, a lower value should be considered (8 is a lower limit, corresponding to constant total 
moment). 
72 

=== PAGE 75 ===

BS EN 1992-1-1:2004 
EN 1992-1-1:2004 (E) 
Note. The value r/ corresponds to a sinusoidal curvature distribution. The value for constant curvature is 8. 
Note that c depends on the distribution of the total curvature, whereas Co in 5.8.7.3 (2) depends on the 
curvature corresponding to the first order moment only. 
5.8.8.3 Curvature 
(1) For members with constant symmetrical cross sections (incl. reinforcement), the following 
may be used: 
11r = Kr¬∑Kcp¬∑1Iro 
where: 
Kr is a correction factor depending on axial load, see 5.8.8.3 (3) 
Kcp is a factor for taking account of creep, see 5.8.8.3 (4) 
11ro = Eyd 1 (0,45 d) 
Eyd = fyd 1 
d is the effective depth; see also 5.8.8.3 (2) (5.34) 
(2) If all reinforcement is not concentrated on opposite sides, but part of it is distributed parallel 
to the plane of bending, d is defined as 
d = (hI2) + is 
where is is the radius of gyration of the total reinforcement area 
(3) Kr in Expression (5.34) should be taken as: 
Kr = (nu n) I (nu nbal):::; 1 
where: 
n = NEd 1 (Ae fed), relative axial force 
NEd is the design value of axial force 
nu = 1 + (JJ (5.35) 
(5.36) 
nbal is the value of n at maximum mon1ent resistance; the value 0,4 may be used 
(0 = As fYd I (Ae fed) 
As is the total area of reinforcement 
Ac is the area of concrete cross section 
(4) The effect of creep should be taken into account by the following factor: 
K<p = 1 + jJlfJef 2 1 
where: 
CjJef is the effective creep ratio, see 5.8.4 
jJ = 0,35 + fek/200 -Al150 
~ A is the slenderness ratio, see 5.8.3.2 @II 
5.8.9 Biaxial bending (5.37) 
(1) The general method described in 5.8.6 may also be used for biaxial bending. The following 
provisions apply when simplified methods are used. Special care should be taken to identify 
the section along the member with the critical combination of moments. 
73 

=== PAGE 76 ===

EN 1992-1-1:2004 (E) 
(2) Separate design in each principal direction, disregarding biaxial bending, may be made as a 
first step. Imperfections need to be taken into account only in the direction where they will have 
the most unfavourable effect. 
(3) No further check is necessary if the slenderness ratios satisfy the following two conditions 
(5.38a) 
[¬ß) and if the relative eccentricities eylheq and ezlbeq (see Figure 5.8) satisfy one the following 
conditions: 
where: 
b, h are the width and depth of the section 
beq = iy ¬∑112 and heq = iz ¬∑112 for an equivalent rectangular section 
Ay, Az are the slenderness ratios lali with respect to y-and z-axis respectively 
iy, iz are the radii of gyration with respect to y-and z-axis respectively 
ez = MEdy I NEd; eccentricity along z-axis 
ey = MEdz I NEd; eccentricity along y-axis 
MEdy is the design moment about y-axis, including second order moment 
MEdz is the design moment about z-axis, including second order moment

(4) If the condition of Expression (5.38) is not fulfilled, biaxial bending should be taken into 
account including the 2nd order effects in each direction (unless they may be ignored according 
to 5.8.2 (6) or 5.8.3). In the absence of an accurate cross section design for biaxial bending, the 
following simplified criterion may be used:

MRdZ/y is the moment resistance in the respective direction 
a is the exponent; 
for circular and elliptical cross sections: a = 2

NEd is the design value of axial force 
NRd = Acfcd + Asfyd, design axial resistance of section. 
where: 
Ac is the gross area of the concrete section 
As is the area of longitudinal reinforcement 
5.9 Lateral instability of slender beams 0,7 1,0 
1,5 2,0 
(1)P Lateral instability of slender beams shall be taken into account where necessary, e.g. for 
precast beams during transport and erection, for beams without sufficient lateral bracing in the 
finished structure etc. Geometric imperfections shall be taken into account. 
(2) A lateral deflection of 11300 should be assumed as a geometric imperfection in the 
verification of beams in unbraced conditions, with 1= total length of beam. In finished 
structures, bracing from connected members may be taken into account 
(3) Second order effects in connection with lateral instability may be ignored if the following 
conditions are fulfilled: 
-persistent situations: lOt 50 and h/b -::; 2,5 (5.40a) --::; 
(hi b y/3 b 
-transient situations: 70 and h/b -::; 3,5 (5.40b) -::; 
b (hi b) 1/3 
where: 
lot is the distance between torsional restraints 
h is the total depth of beam in central part of lOt 
b is the width of compression flange 
(4) Torsion associated with lateral instability should be taken into account in the design of 
supporting structures. 
5.10 Prestressed members and structures 
5.10.1 General 
(1)P The prestress considered in this Standard is that applied to the concrete by stressed 
tendons. 
(2) The effects of prestressing may be considered as an action or a resistance caused by 
prestrain and precurvature. The bearing capacity should be calculated accordingly. 
75 

=== PAGE 78 ===

BS EN 1992-1-1:2004 
EN 1992-1-1:2004 (E) 
(3) In general prestress is introduced in the action combinations defined in EN 1990 as part of 
the loading cases and its effects should be included in the applied internal moment and axial 
force. 
(4) Following the assumptions of (3) above, the contribution of the prestressing tendons to the 
resistance of the section should be limited to their additional strength beyond prestressing. This 
may be calculated assuming that the origin of the stress/strain relationship of the tendons is 
displaced by the effects of prestressing. 
(5)P Brittle failure of the member caused by failure of prestressing tendons shall be avoided. 
(6) Brittle failure should be avoided by one or more of the following methods: 
Method A: Provide minimum reinforcement in accordance with 9.2.1. 
Method B: Provide pretensioned bonded tendons. 
Method C: Provide easy access to prestressed concrete members in order to check and 
control the condition of tendons by non-destructive methods or by monitoring. 
Method 0: Provide satisfactory evidence concerning the reliability of the tendons. 
Method Ensure that if failure were to occur due to either an increase of load or a 
reduction of prestress under the frequent combination of actions, cracking would 
occur before the ultimate capacity would be exceeded, taking account of moment 
redistribution due to cracking effects. 
Note: The selection of Methods to be used in a Country may be found in its National Annex. 
5.10.2 Prestressing force during tensioning 
5.10.2.1 Maximum stressing force 
(1)P The force applied to a tendon, Pmax (i.e. the force at the active end during tensioning) shall 
not exceed the following value: 
Pmax = Ap . O"p,max 
where: 
Ap is the cross-sectional area of the tendon 
O"p,max is the maximum stress applied to the tendon 
= min { k1¬∑ fpk ; k2' fpO,1k} (5.41 ) 
Note: The values of k1 and k2 for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The recommended 
values are k1 = 0,8 and k2 = 0,9 
(2) Overstressing is permitted if the force in the jack can be measured to an accuracy of ¬± 5 % 
of the final value of the prestressing force. In such cases the maximum prestressing force Pmax 
~may be increased to k3¬∑ fpO,1k' Ap (e.g. for the occurrence of an unexpected high friction in@j] 
long-line pretensioning). 
76 Note: The values of k3 for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The recommended value is 
0,95.

EN 1992-1-1:2004 (E) 
5.10.2.2 Limitation of concrete stress 
(1)P Local concrete crushing or splitting at the end of pre-and post-tensioned n1embers shall 
be avoided. 
(2) Local concrete crushing or splitting behind post-tensioning anchors should be avoided in 
accordance with the relevant European Technical Approval. 
(3) The strength of concrete at application of or transfer of prestress should not be less than 
the rTlinimum value defined in the relevant European Technical Approval. 
(4) If prestress in an individual tendon is applied in steps, the required concrete strength may 
be reduced. The n1inimum strength fcm(t) at the time t should be k4 [%] of the required concrete 
strength for full prestressing given in the European Technical Approval. Between the minimun1 
strength and the required concrete strength for full prestressing, the prestress may be 
interpolated between k5 [%>] and 100%> of the full prestressing. 
Note: The values of k4 and ks for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The recommended 
value for k4 is 50 and for k5 is 30. 
(5) The concrete con~lpressive stress in the structure resulting from the prestressing force and 
other loads acting at the time of tensioning or release of prestress, should be limited to: 
(5.42) 
where fck(t) is the characteristic compressive strength of the concrete at time t when it is 
subjected to the prestressing force. 
For pretensioned elements the stress at the time of transfer of prestress may be increased to 
k6' fck(t) , if it can be justified by tests or experience that longitudinal cracking is prevented. 
Note: The value of k6 for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The recommended value is 
0,7. 
If the compressive stress permanently exceeds 0,45 fck(t) the non-linearity of creep should be 
taken into account. 
5.10.2.3 Measurements 
(1)P In post-tensioning the prestressing force and the related elongation of the tendon shall be 
checked by measurements and the actual losses due to friction shall be controlled. 
5.10.3 Prestress force 
(1)P At a given time t and distance x (or arc length) from the active end of the tendon the mean 
prestress force Pm,t(x) is equal to the maximum force Pmax imposed at the active end, minus the 
immediate losses and the time dependent losses (see below). Absolute values are considered 
for all the losses. 
(2) The value of the initial prestress force Pmo(x) (at time t = to) applied to the concrete 
immediately after tensioning and anchoring (post-tensioning) or after transfer of prestressing 
(pre-tensioning) is obtained by subtracting from the force at tensioning Pmax the immediate 
losses i1Pi(x) and should not exceed the following value: 
77 

=== PAGE 80 ===

BS EN 1992-1-1:2004 
EN 1992-1-1:2004 (E) 
PmO(X) = Ap' O"pmO(x) 
where: 
O"pmo(x) is the stress in the tendon immediately after tensioning or transfer 
= min { k7' fpk; ksfpo,1k} (5.43) 
Note: The values of k7 and k8 for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The recommended 
value for k7 is 0,75 and for k8 is 0,85 
(3) When determining the immediate losses flPi(x) the following immediate influences should 
be considered for pre-tensioning and post-tensioning where relevant (see 5.10.4 and 5.10.5): 
-losses due to elastic deformation of concrete flPel 
-losses due to short term relaxation flPr 
losses due to friction flP~I(X) 
losses due to anchorage slip flPsl 
(4) The mean value of the prestress force Pm,t(x) at the time t> to should be determined with 
respect to the prestressing method. In addition to the immediate losses given in (3) the time¬≠
dependent losses of prestress flPc+s+r(x) (see 5.10.6) as a result of creep and shrinkage of the 
concrete and the long term relaxation of the prestressing steel should be considered and Pm,t(x) 
= Pmo(x) -flPc+s+r(X). 
5.10.4 Immediate losses of prestress for pre-tensioning 
(1) The following losses occurring during pre-tensioning should be considered: 
(i) during the stressing process: loss due to friction at the bends (in the case of curved wires 
or strands) and losses due to wedge draw-in of the anchorage devices. 
(ii) before the transfer of prestress to concrete: loss due to relaxation of the pretensioning 
tendons during the period which elapses between the tensioning of the tendons and 
prestressing of the concrete. 
Note: In case of heat curing, losses due to shrinkage and relaxation are modified and should be assessed 
accordingly; direct thermal effect should also be considered ~ (see 10.3.2.1 and Annex D)@il 
(iii) at the transfer of prestress to concrete: loss due to elastic deformation of concrete as 
the result of the action of pre-tensioned tendons when they are released from the 
anchorages. 
5.10.5 Immediate losses of prestress for post-tensioning 
5.10.5.1 Losses due to the instantaneous deformation of concrete 
(1) Account should be taken of the loss in tendon force corresponding to the deformation of 
concrete, taking account the order in which the tendons are stressed. 
(2) This loss, flPe/, may be assumed as a mean loss in each tendon as follows: 
(5.44) 
where: 
~O"c(t) is the variation of stress at the centre of gravity of the tendons applied at time t 
78 

=== PAGE 81 ===

EN 1992-1-1:2004 (E) 
j is a coefficient equal to 
(n -1 )/2n where n is the number of identical tendons successively 
prestressed. As an approximation j may be taken as 1/2 
1 for the variations due to permanent actions applied after prestressing. 
5.10.5.2 losses due to friction 
(1) The losses due to friction !1PIJ(x) in post-tensioned tendons may be estimated from: 
P ( 1 e tt( 0 + kx ) ) 
max (5.45) 
where: 
B is the sum of the angular displacements over a distance x (irrespective of direction or 
sign) 
f-L is the coefficient of friction between the tendon and its duct 
k is an unintentional angular displacement for internal tendons (per unit length) 
x is the distance along the tendon from the point where the prestressing force is equal 
to Pmax (the force at the active end during tensioning) 
The values f-L and k are given in the relevant European Technical Approval. The value f-L 
depends on the surface characteristics of the tendons and the duct, on the presence of rust, on 
the elongation of the tendon and on the tendon profile. 
The value k for unintentional angular displacement depends on the quality of workmanship, on 
the distance between tendon supports, on the type of duct or sheath employed, and on the 
degree of vibration used in placing the concrete. 
(2) In the absence of data given in a European Technical Approval the values for /-L given in 
Table 5.1 may be assumed, when using Expression (5.45). 
(3) In the absence of data in a European Technical Approval, values for unintended regular 
displacements for internal tendons will generally be in the range 0,005 < k < 0,01 per metre. 
(4) For external tendons, the losses of prestress due to unintentional angles may be ignored.

during the operation of anchoring after tensioning, and due to the deformation of the anchorage 
itself.

(2) Values of the wedge draw-in are given in the European Technical Approval. 
5.10.6 Time dependent losses of prestress for pre-and post-tensioning 
(1) The time dependent losses may be calculated by considering the following two reductions 
of stress: 
(a) due to the reduction of strain, caused by the deformation of concrete due to creep and 
shrinkage, under the permanent loads: 
(b) the reduction of stress in the steel due to the relaxation under tension. 
Note: The relaxation of steel depends on the concrete deformation due to creep and shrinkage. This 
interaction can generally and approximately be taken into account by a reduction factor 0,8. 
(2) A simplified method to evaluate time dependent losses at location x under the permanent 
loads is given by Expression (5.46).

5.10.7 Consideration of prestress in analysis 
(1) Second order moments can arise from prestressing with external tendons. 
(2) Moments from secondary effects of prestressing arise only in statically indeterminate 
structures. 
(3) For linear analysis both the primary and secondary effects of prestressing should be applied 
before any redistribution of forces and moments is considered (see 5.5). 
(4) In plastic and non-linear analysis the secondary effect of prestress may be treated as 
additional plastic rotations which should then be included in the check of rotation capacity. 
(5) Rigid bond between steel and concrete may be assumed after grouting of post-tensioned 
tendons. However before grouting the tendons should be considered as unbonded. 
(6) External tendons may be assumed to be straight between deviators. 
5.10.8 Effects of prestressing at ultimate limit state 
(1) In general the design value of the prestressing force may be determined by Pd,t(x) = 
(p,Pm,t(x) (see 5.10.3 (4) for the definition of Pm,t(x)) and 2.4.2.2 for rp. 
(2) For prestressed members with permanently unbonded tendons, it is generally necessary to 
take the deformation of the whole member into account when calculating the increase of the 
stress in the prestressing steel. If no detailed calculation is made, it may be assumed that the 
increase of the stress from the effective prestress to the stress in the ultimate limit state is 
L\()p,ULS' 
Note: The value of ilO"p,ULS for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The recommended value 
is 100 MPa. 
(3) If the stress increase is calculated using the deformation state of the whole member the 
mean values of the material properties should be used. The design value of the stress increase 
L\()pd = L\()p' r~p should be determined by applying partial safety factors r~p,sup and r~p,inf 
respectively. 
Note: The values of r~p,sup and np,inf for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The 
recommended values for r~p,sup and r~p,inf are 1,2 and 0,8 respectively. If linear analysis with uncracked 
sections is applied, a lower limit of deformations may be assumed and the recommended value for both r~p,sup 
and r~p,inf is 1,0. 
5.10.9 Effects of prestressing at serviceability limit state and limit state of fatigue 
(1)P For serviceability and fatigue calculations allowance shall be made for possible variations 
in prestress. Two characteristic values of the prestressing force at the serviceability limit state 
are estimated from: 
Pk,sup = (sup Pm,t (x) 
Pk,inf = linf Pm,t(x) 
where: 
Pk,sup is the upper characteristic value 
Pk,inf is the lower characteristic value (5.47) 
(5.48)

Note: The values of rsup and linf for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The recommended 
values are: 
-for pre-tensioning or unbonded tendons: rsup 1,05 and rinf = 0,95 
-for post-tensioning with bonded tendons: rsup 1,10 and linf = 0,90 
-when appropriate measures (e.g. direct measurements of pretensioning) are taken: rsup = lint = 1,0. 
5.11 Analysis for some particular structural members 
(1)P Slabs supported on columns are defined as flat slabs. 
(2)P Shear walls are plain or reinforced concrete walls that contribute to lateral stability of the 
structure. 
Note: For information concerning the analysis of flat slabs and shear walls see Annex I.

SECTION 6 ULTIMATE LIMIT STATES (ULS) 
6.1 Bending with or without axial force 
(1)P This section applies to undisturbed regions of beanls, slabs and similar types of members 
for which sections remain approximately plane before and after loading. The discontinuity 
regions of beams and other members in which plane sections do not remain plane may be 
designed and detailed according to 6.5. 
(2)P When determining the ultinlate nl0nlent resistance of reinforced or prestressed concrete 
cross-sections, the following assumptions are made: 
-plane sections remain plane. 
the strain in bonded reinforcement or bonded prestressing tendons, whether in tension or 
in compression, is the same as that in the surrounding concrete. 
the tensile strength of the concrete is ignored. 
the stresses in the concrete in compression are derived from the design stress/strain 
relationship given in 3.1.7. 
the stresses in the reinforcing or prestressing steel are derived from the design curves in 
3.2 (Figure 3.8) and 3.3 (Figure 3.10). 
the initial strain in prestressing tendons is taken into account when assessing the 
stresses in the tendons. 
(3)P The cOrTlpressive strain in the concrete shall be limited to ccu2, or ccu3, depending on the 
stress-strain diagram used, see 3.1.7 and Table 3.1. The strains in the reinforcing steel and the 
prestressing steel shall be lin'dted to cud (where applicable); see 3.2.7 (2) and 3.3.6 (7) 
respectively. 
~ (4) For cross-sections loaded by the compression force it is necessary to assume the minimum 
eccentricity, eo = h/30 but not less than 20 mm where h is the depth of the section. @2] 
~(5) In parts of cross-sections which are subjected to approximately concentric loading (ed/h ~ 
0,1), such as compression flanges of box girders, the mean compressive strain in that part of 
the section should be limited to cc2 (or cc3 if the bilinear relation of Figure 3.4 is used).@l] 
(6) The possible range of strain distributions is shown in Figure 6.1. 
(7) For prestressed members with permanently unbonded tendons see 5.10.8. 
(8) For external prestressing tendons the strain in the prestressing steel between two 
subsequent contact points (anchors or deviation saddles) is assumed to be constant. The strain 
in the prestressing steel is then equal to the initial strain, realised just after completion of the 
prestressing operation, increased by the strain resulting from the structural deformation 
between the contact areas considered. See also 5.10.

6.2 Shear 
6.2.1 General verification procedure 
(1)P For the verification of the shear resistance the following symbols are defined: 
VRd,c is the design shear resistance of the member without shear reinforcement. 
VRd,s is the design value of the shear force which can be sustained by the yielding shear 
reinforcement. 
VRd,max is the design value of the maximum shear force which can be sustained by the 
member, limited by crushing of the compression struts. 
In members with inclined chords the following additional values are defined (see Figure 6.2): 
84 Vccd is the design value of the shear component of the force in the compression area, in 
the case of an inclined compression chord. 
Vtd is the design value of the shear component of the force in the tensile reinforcenlent, 
in the case of an inclined tensile chord. 
Figure 6.2: Shear component for members with inclined chords

EN 1992-1-1:2004 (E) 
(2) The shear resistance of a member with shear reinforcement is equal to: 
(6.1 ) 
(3) In regions of the member where VEd SVRd,c no calculated shear reinforcement is necessary. 
VEd is the design shear force in the section considered resulting from external loading and 
prestressing (bonded or unbonded). 
(4) When, on the basis of the design shear calculation, no shear reinforcement is required, 
minimum shear reinforcement should nevertheless be provided according to 9.2.2. The 
minimum shear reinforcement may be omitted in members such as slabs (solid, ribbed or 
hollow core slabs) where transverse redistribution of loads is possible. Minimum reinforcement 
may also be omitted in members of minor importance (e.g. lintels with span 2 m) which do not 
contribute significantly to the overall resistance and stability of the structure. 
(5) In regions where VEd > VRd,c according to Expression (6.2), sufficient shear reinforcement 
~ should be provided in order that VEd ~ VRd (see Expression (6.1 )).@j] 
(6) The sum of the design shear force and the contributions of the flanges, VEd Vccd - Vtd, 
should not exceed the permitted maximum value VRd,max (see 6.2.3), anywhere in the member. 
(7) The longitudinal tension reinforcement should be able to resist the additional tensile force 
caused by shear (see 6.2.3 (7)). 
(8) For members subject to predominantly uniformly distributed loading the design shear force 
need not to be checked at a distance less than d from the face of the support. Any shear 
reinforcement required should continue to the support. In addition it should be verified that the 
shear at the support does not exceed VRd,max (see also 6.2.2 (6) and 6.2.3 (8). 
(9) Where a load is applied near the bottom of a section, sufficient vertical reinforcement to 
carry the load to the top of the section should be provided in addition to any reinforcement 
required to resist shear. 
6.2.2 Members not requiring design shear reinforcement 
(1) The design value for the shear resistance VRd,c is given by: 
VRd,c = [CRd,ck(100 PI fck) 1/3 + k1 O"cp] bwd

bw is the smallest width of the cross-section in the tensile area [mm]

(2) In prestressed single span members without shear reinforcement, the shear resistance of 
the regions cracked in bending may be calculated using Expression (6.2a). In regions 
uncracked in bending (where the flexural tensile stress is smaller than fctk,o,05/YC) the shear 
resistance should be limited by the tensile strength of the concrete. In these regions the shear 
resistance is given by: 
I . bw ~ ( )2 VRd,c = -s- fctd + a'O"Cpfctd (6.4) 
where 
I is the second moment of area 
is the width of the cross-section at the centroidal axis, allowing for the presence of 
ducts in accordance with Expressions (6.16) and (6.17) s is the first moment of area above and about the centroidal axis 
a, Ixllpt2 ~ 1,0 for pretensioned tendons 
= 1,0 for other types of prestressing 
Ix is the distance of section considered from the starting pOint of the transmission 
length 
Ipt2 is the upper bound value of the transmission length of the prestressing element 
according to Expression (8.18). 
O-cp is the concrete compressive stress at the centroidal axis due to axial loading 
and/or prestressing (O"cP = NEd /Ac in MPa, NEd> 0 in compression) 
For cross-sections where the width varies over the height, the maximum principal stress may 
occur on an axis other than the centroidal axis. In such a case the minimum value of the shear 
resistance should be found by calculating VRd,c at various axes in the cross-section.

(3) The calculation of the shear resistance according to Expression (6.4) is not required for 
cross-sections that are nearer to the support than the point which is the intersection of the 
elastic centroidal axis and a line inclined from the inner edge of the support at an angle of 45¬∞. 
(4) For the general case of members subjected to a bending moment and an axial force, which 
can be shown to be uncracked in flexure at the ULS, reference is made to 12.6.3. 
(S) For the design of the longitudinal reinforcement, in the region cracked in flexure, the MEd -
line should be shifted over a distance 81 = d in the unfavourable direction (see 9.2.1.3 (2)). 
(6) For members with loads applied on the upper side within a distance 0,5d::; 8v::; 2d from 
the edge of a support (or centre of bearing where flexible bearings are used), the contribution 
of this load to the shear force VEd may be multiplied by p = 8v/2.d. This reduction may be 
applied for checking VRd,c in Expression (6.2.a). This is only valid provided that the 
longitudinal reinforcement is fully anchored at the support. For 8v O,Sd the value 8v = 0,5d 
should be used. 
The shear force VEd, calculated without reduction by p, should however always satisfy the 
condition 
(6.5) 
where v is a strength reduction factor for concrete cracked in shear 
Note: The value vfor use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The recommended value follows

and 
VRd,max = acw bw Z V1 fCd/(Cote + tane) 
where: 
Asw is the cross-sectional area of the shear rei nforcement 
s is the spacing of the stirrups 
fywd is the design yield strength of the shear reinforcement 
V1 is a strength reduction factor for concrete cracked in shear (6.8)

Note 1: The value of V1 andacw for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The recommended 
value of V1 is v(see Expression (6.6N)).

Cf ep is the mean compressive stress, measured positive, in the concrete due to the design axial force. 
This should be obtained by averaging it over the concrete section taking account of the reinforcement. 
The value of CTep need not be calculated at a distance less than 0.5d cot e from the edge of the support.

(5) In regions where there is no discontinuity of VEd Illi> (e.g. for uniformly distributed loading 
applied at the top) the shear reinforcement in any length increment 1= z( cote) may be 
calculated using the smallest value of VEd in the increment. 
(6) Where the web contains grouted metal ducts with a diameter ¬¢ > bw/8 the shear 
resistance VRd,max should be calculated on the basis of a nominal web thickness given by: 
bw,nom = bw -0,5L¬¢ (6.16) 
where ¬¢ is the outer diameter of the duct and L¬¢ is determined for the most unfavourable 
level. 
For grouted metal ducts with ¬¢ bw 18, bw,nom = bw 
For non-grouted ducts, grouted plastic ducts and unbonded tendons the nominal web thickness 
is: 
bw,nom = bw -1 ,2 L¬¢ (6.17) 
The value 1,2 in Expression (6.17) is introduced to take account of splitting of the concrete 
struts due to transverse tension. If adequate transverse reinforcement is provided this value 
may be reduced to 1,0. 
(7) The additional tensile force, f1Ftd, in the longitudinal reinforcement due to shear VEd may be 
calculated from: 
f1Ftd= 0,5 VEd (cot e -cot a ) (6.18) 
(MEd/z) + f1Ftd should be taken not greater than MEd,max/z, where MEd,max is the maximum 
moment along the beam. 
(8) For members with loads applied on the upper side within a distance 0,5d 8v ~ 2,Od the 
contribution of this load to the shear force VEd may be reduced by f3 = 8v/2d. 
The shear force VEd, calculated in this way, should satisfy the condition 
(6.19) 
where Asw.fYWd is the resistance of the shear reinforcement crossing the inclined shear crack 
between the loaded areas (see Figure 6.6). Only the shear reinforcement within the central 
0,75 8v should be taken into account. The reduction by fJshould only be applied for 
calculating the shear reinforcement. It is only valid provided that the longitudinal 
reinforcement is fully anchored at the support.

(1) The shear strength of the flange may be calculated by considering the flange as a system 
of compressive struts combined with ties in the form of tensile reinforcement. 
(2) A minimum amount of longitudinal reinforcement should be provided, as specified in 9.3.1.

To prevent crushing of the compression struts in the flange, the following condition should be 
satisfied:

Note: The permitted range of the values for cot a f for use in a country may be found in its National Annex. 
The recommended values in the absence of more rigorous calculation are:

1,0 cot a f 1,25 for tension flanges (450 2 38,6¬∞) 
(5) In the case of combined shear between the flange and the web, and transverse bending, 
the area of steel should be the greater than that given by Expression (6.21) or half that given by 
Expression (6.21) plus that required for transverse bending. 
(6) If VEd is less than or equal to kfctd no extra reinforcement above that for flexure is required. 
Note: The value of k for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The recommended value is 0,4. 
(7) Longitudinal tension reinforcement in the flange should be anchored beyond the strut 
required to transmit the force back to the web at the section where this reinforcement is 
required (See Section (A -A) of Figure 6.7).

6.3 Torsion 
6.3.1 General 
(1)P Where the static equilibrium of a structure depends on the torsional resistance of 
elements of the structure, a full torsional design covering both ultimate and serviceability limit 
states shall be made. 
(2) Where, in statically indeterminate structures, torsion arises from consideration of 
compatibility only, and the structure is not dependent on the torsional resistance for its stability, 
then it will normally be unnecessary to consider torsion at the ultimate limit state. In such cases 
a minimum reinforcement, given in Sections 7.3 and 9.2, in the form of stirrups and longitudinal 
bars should be provided in order to prevent excessive cracking. 
(3) The torsional resistance of a section may be calculated on the basis of a thin-walled closed 
section, in which equilibrium is satisfied by a closed shear flow. Solid sections may be modelled 
by equivalent thin-walled sections. Complex shapes, such as T -sections, may be divided into a 
series of sub-sections, each of which is modelled as an equivalent thin-walled section, and the 
total torsional resistance taken as the sum of the capacities of the individual elements. 
(4) The distribution of the acting torsional moments over the sub-sections should be in 
proportion to their uncracked torsional stiffnesses. For non-solid sections the equivalent wall 
thickness should not exceed the actual wall thickness. 
(5) Each sub-section may be designed separately.

6.3.2 Design procedure 
(1) The shear stress in a wall of a section subject to a pure torsional moment may be 
calculated from: 
Tt ,t f' = 
,1 e,1 2A 
k 
The shear force VEd,i in a wall i due to torsion is given by:

Ak is the area enclosed by the centre-lines of the connecting walls, including inner 
hollow areas. 
Tt,i is the torsional shear stress in wall i 
tef,i is the effective wall thickness. It may be taken as Alu, but should not be taken as 
less than twice the distance between edge and centre of the longitudinal 
reinforcement. For hollow sections the real thickness is an upper limit 
A is the total area of the cross-section within the outer circumference, including inner 
hollow areas 
u is the outer circumference of the cross-section 
Zi is the side length of wall i defined by the distance between the 
intersection points with the adjacent walls 
(2) The effects of torsion and shear for both hollow and solid members may be superimposed, 
assuming the same value for the strut inclination O. The limits for 0 given in 6.2.3 (2) are also 
fully applicable for the case of combined shear and torsion. 
The nlaximum bearing capacity of a member loaded in shear and torsion follows from 6.3.2 (4). 
(3) The required cross-sectional area of the longitudinal reinforcement for torsion LAsl may be 
calculated from Expression (6.28):

where 
Uk is the perimeter of the area Ak 
fyd is the design yield stress of the longitudinal reinforcement Asl 
e is the angle of cOrTlpression struts (see Figure 6.5). (6.28) 
In compressive chords, the longitudinal reinforcement nlay be reduced in proportion to the 
available compressive force. In tensile chords the longitudinal reinforcement for torsion should 
be added to the other reinforcement. The longitudinal reinforcement should generally be 
distributed over the length of side, Zj, but for smaller sections it may be concentrated at the ends 
of this length. 
(4) The maximum resistance of a member subjected to torsion and shear is limited by the 
capacity of the concrete struts. In order not to exceed this resistance the following condition 
should be satisfied: 
(6.29) 
where: 
TEd is the design torsional moment 
VEd is the design transverse force 
TRd,max is the design torsional resistance moment according to 
(6.30)

VRd,max is the maximum design shear resistance according to Expressions (6.9) or 
(6.14). In solid cross sections the full width of the web may be used to determine 
VRd,max 
(5) For approximately rectangular solid sections only minimum reinforcement is required (see 
9.2.1.1) provided that the following condition is satisfied: 
(6.31) 
where 
TRd,c is the torsional cracking moment, which may be deterrTlined by setting Tt,i = fctd 
VRd,c follows from Expression (6.2) 
6.3.3 Warping torsion 
(1) For closed thin-walled sections and solid sections, warping torsion may normally be 
ignored. 
(2) In open thin walled members it may be necessary to consider warping torsion. For very 
slender cross-sections the calculation should be carried out on the basis of a beam-grid model 
and for other cases on the basis of a truss model. In all cases the design should be carried out 
according to the design rules for bending and longitudinal normal force, and for shear.

(1)P The rules in this Section complement those given in 6.2 and cover punching shear in solid 
slabs, waffle slabs with solid areas over columns, and foundations. 
(2)P Punching shear can result from a concentrated load or reaction acting on a relatively small 
area, called the loaded area A10ad of a slab or a foundation. 
(3) An appropriate verification model for checking punching failure at the ultimate limit state is 
shown in Figure 6.12.

(5) The rules given in 6.4 are principally formulated for the case of uniformly distributed 
loading. In special cases, such as footings, the load within the control perimeter adds to the 
resistance of the structural system, and may be subtracted when deterlTlining the design 
punching shear stress. 
6.4.2 Load distribution and basic control perimeter 
(1) The basic control perimeter U1 may normally be taken to be at a distance 2,Od from the 
loaded area and should be constructed so as to minilTlise its length (see Figure 6.13). 
The effective depth of the slab is assumed constant and may normally be taken as: 
where dy and dz are the effective depths of the reinforcement in two orthogonal directions.

(2) Control perimeters at a distance less than 2d should be considered where the concentrated 
force is opposed by a high pressure (e.g. soil pressure on a base), or by the effects of a load or 
reaction within a distance 2d of the periphery of area of application of the force. 
(3) For loaded areas situated near openings, if the shortest distance between the perimeter of 
the loaded area and the edge of the opening does not exceed 6d, that part of the control 
perimeter contained between two tangents drawn to the outline of the opening from the centre 
of the loaded area is considered to be ineffective (see Figure 6.14).

edge reinforcement should always be provided, see 9.3.1.4. 
(6) The control section is that which follows the control perimeter and extends over the 
effective depth d. For slabs of constant depth, the control section is perpendicular to the middle 
plane of the slab. For slabs or footings of variable depth other than step footings, the effective 
depth may be assumed to be the depth at the perimeter of the loaded area as shown in Figure

6.4.3 Punching shear calculation 
(1)P The design procedure for punching shear is based on checks at the face of the column 
and at the basic control perimeter U1. If shear reinforcement is required a further perimeter Uout,ef 
(see figure 6.22) should be found where shear reinforcement is no longer required. The 
following design shear stresses (MPa) along the control sections, are defined: 
VRd,c is the design value of the punching shear resistance of a slab without punching shear 
reinforcement along the control section considered. 
VRd,cs is the design value of the punching shear resistance of a slab with punching shear 
reinforcement along the control section considered. 
VRd,max is the design value of the maximum punching shear resistance along the control 
section considered. 
(2) The following checks should be carried out: 
(a) At the column perimeter, or the perimeter of the loaded area, the maximum punching 
shear stress should not be exceeded: 
(b) Punching shear reinforcement is not necessary if: 
(c) Where VEd exceeds the value VRd,c for the control section considered, punching shear 
reinforcement should be provided according to 6.4.5. 
(3) Where the support reaction is eccentric with regard to the control perimeter, the maximum 
shear stress should be taken as: 
(6.38) 
where 
d is the mean effective depth of the slab, which may be taken as (dy + dz)/2 where: 
dy, dz is the effective depths in the y-and z-directions of the control section 
Uj is the length of the control perimeter being considered 
{3 is given by: 
f3 = 1 + k MEd ‚Ä¢ ~ 
VEd ~ (6.39) 
where 
U1 is the length of the basic control perimeter 
k is a coefficient dependent on the ratio between the column dimensions C1 and C2: its 
value is a function of the proportions of the unbalanced moment transmitted by 
uneven shear and by bending and torsion (see Table 6.1). 
W1 corresponds to a distribution of shear as illustrated in Figure 6.19 and is a function of 
the basic control perimeter U1:

dl is a length increment of the perimeter 
e is the distance of dl from the axis about which the moment MEd acts

where: 
C1 is the column dimension parallel to the eccentricity of the load 
C2 is the column dimension perpendicular to the eccentricity of the load 
For internal circular columns f3 follows from: 
e f3 = 1 + O,6n -¬≠D+4d 
where 0 is the diameter of the circular column 
~ e is the eccentricity of the applied load e = MEd / VEd @il (6.41 ) 
(6.42) 
For an internal rectangular column where the loading is eccentric to both axes, the following 
approximate expression for f3 may be used: 
p = 1 + 1,8 l :: J + l ~J 
where: 
ey and ez 
by and bz are the eccentricities MEd/VEd along y and z axes respectively 
is the dimensions of the control perimeter (see Figure 6.13) 
Note: ey results from a moment about the z axis and ez from a moment about the yaxis. (6.43) 
(4) For edge column connections, where the eccentricity perpendicular to the slab edge 
(resulting from a moment about an axis parallel to the slab edge) is toward the interior and there 
is no eccentricity parallel to the edge, the punching force may be considered to be uniformly 
distributed along the control perimeter U1* as shown in Figure 6.20(a).

U1* is the reduced basic control perimeter (see Figure 6.20(a))

perpendicular to the slab edge. 
k may be determined from Table 6.1 with the ratio c1/c2 replaced by c1/2c2

For a rectangular column as shown in Figure 6.20(a): 
(6.45) 
If the eccentricity perpendicular to the slab edge is not toward the interior, Expression (6.39) 
applies. When calculating W1 ~ the distance e should be measured from the centroid axis 
of the control perimeter.@j] 
(5) For corner column connections, where the eccentricity is toward the interior of the slab, it is 
assumed that the punching force is uniformly distributed along the reduced control perimeter 
U1*, as defined in Figure 6.20(b). The fj-value may then be considered as: 
(J (6.46) 
If the eccentricity is toward the exterior, Expression (6.39) applies.

action of the soil pressure.

(1)P Where a non-linear strain distribution exists (e.g. supports, near concentrated loads or 
plain stress) strut-and-tie models may be used (see also 5.6.4). 
6.5.2 Struts 
(1) The design strength for a concrete strut in a region with transverse compressive stress or 
no transverse stress may be calculated from Expression (6.55) (see Figure 6.23).

no transverse stress 
Figure 6.23: Design strength of concrete struts without transverse tension 
It may be appropriate to assume a higher design strength in regions where multi-axial 
compression exists. (6.55) 
(2) The design strength for concrete struts should be reduced in cracked compression zones 
and, unless a more rigorous approach is used, may be calculated from Expression (6.56) (see 
Figure 6.24). 
O'Rd,max

O'Rd,max = 0,6 Vfcd (6.56) 
Note: The value of v for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The recommended value is 
given by equation (6.S7N). 
v = 1 fck/2S0 (6.S7N) 
(3) For struts between directly loaded areas, such as corbels or short deep beams, alternative 
calculation methods are given in 6.2.2 and 6.2.3. 
6.5.3 Ties 
(1) The design strength of transverse ties and reinforcement should be limited in accordance 
with 3.2 and 3.3. 
(2) Reinforcement should be adequately anchored in the nodes.

(3) Reinforcement required to resist the forces at the concentrated nodes may be smeared 
over a length (see Figure 6.25 a) and b)). When the reinforcement in the node area extends 
over a considerable length of an element, the reinforcement should be distributed over the 
length where the compression trajectories are curved (ties and struts). The tensile force T may 
be obtained by: 
a) for partial discontinuity regions (b :S ~J. see Figure 6.25 a:

6.5.4 Nodes 
(1)P The rules for nodes also apply to regions where concentrated forces are transferred in a 
member and which are not designed by the strut-and-tie method. 
(2)P The forces acting at nodes shall be in equilibrium. Transverse tensile forces 
perpendicular to an in-plane node shall be considered. 
(3) The dimensioning and detailing of concentrated nodes are critical in determining their load¬≠
bearing resistance. Concentrated nodes may develop, e.g. where point loads are applied, at 
supports, in anchorage zones with concentration of reinforcement or prestressing tendons, at 
bends in reinforcing bars, and at connections and corners of members. 
(4) The design values for the compressive stresses within nodes may be determined by: 
a) in compression nodes where no ties are anchored at the node (see Figure 6.26)

(5) Under the conditions listed below, the design compressive stress values given in 6.5.4 (4) 
may be increased by up t0100/0 where at least one of the following applies: 
triaxial compression is assured, 
all angles between struts and ties are ~ 550
, 
the stresses applied at supports or at point loads are uniform, and the node is confined 
by stirrups, 
the reinforcement is arranged in multiple layers, 
the node is reliably confined by means of bearing arrangement or friction. 
(6) Triaxially compressed nodes may be checked according to Expression (3.24) and (3.25) 
with an upper limit (JEd,max k4 V'fed if for all three directions of the struts the distribution of 
load is known. 
Note: The value of k4 for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The recommended value is 3,0. 
(7) The anchorage of the reinforcement in compression-tension nodes starts at the beginning 
of the node, e.g. in case of a support anchorage starting at its inner face (see Figure 6.27). The 
anchorage length should extend over the entire node length. In certain cases, the reinforcement 
may also be anchored behind the node. For anchorage and bending of reinforcement, see 8.4 
to 8.6. 
(8) In-plane compression nodes at the junction of three struts may be verified in accordance 
with Figure 6.26. The maximum average principal node stresses ((JeO, (Je1, (Je2, (Je3) should be 
checked in accordance with 6.5.4 (4) a). Normally the following may be assumed: 
Fcd.1/a1 Fcd,2ia2 = Fcd,-ya3 resulting in (Jed,1 = (Jed,2 = (Jed,3 = (Jed ,a. 
(9) Nodes at reinforcement bends may be analysed in accordance with Figure 6.28. Tile 
average stresses in the struts should be checked in accordance with 6.5.4 (5). The diameter of 
the mandrel should be checked ~ in accordance with 8.3. @l]

6.6 Anchorages and laps 
(1)P The design bond stress is limited to a value depending on the surface characteristics of 
the reinforcement, the tensile strength of the concrete and confinement of surrounding 
concrete. This depends on cover, transverse reinforcement and transverse pressure. 
(2) The length necessary for developing the required tensile force in an anchorage or lap is 
calculated on the basis of a constant bond stress. 
(3) Application rules for the design and detailing of anchorages and laps are given in B.4 to B.B. 
6.7 Partially loaded areas 
(1)P For partially loaded areas, local crushing (see below) and transverse tension forces (see 
6.5) shall be considered. 
(2) For a uniform distribution of load on an area Aco (see Figure 6.29) the concentrated 
resistance force may be determined as follows: 
FRdu = Aco . fCd ‚Ä¢ ~ Ac1 / Aco ::; 3,0 . fCd ‚Ä¢ Aco 
where: (6.63) 
Aco is the loaded area, 
Ac1 is the maximum design distribution area with a similar shape to Aco 
(3) The design distribution area Ac1 required for the resistance force FRdu should correspond to 
the following conditions: 
The height for the load distribution in the load direction should correspond to the 
conditions given in Figure 6.29 
the centre of the design distribution area Ac1 should be on the line of action passing 
through the centre of the load area Aco. 
If there is more than one compression force acting on the concrete cross section, the 
designed distribution areas should not overlap. 
The value of FRdu should be reduced if the load is not uniformly distributed on the area Aco or 
if high shear forces exist.

6.8 Fatigue 
6.8.1 Verification conditions 
(1)P The resistance of structures to fatigue shall be verified in special cases. This verification 
shall be performed separately for concrete and steel. 
(2) A fatigue verification should be carried out for structures and structural components which 
are subjected to regular load cycles (e.g. crane-rails, bridges exposed to high traffic loads). 
6.8.2 Internal forces and stresses for fatigue verification 
(1)P The stress calculation shall be based on the assumption of cracked cross sections 
neglecting the tensile strength of concrete but satisfying compatibility of strains. 
(2)P The effect of different bond behaviour of prestressing and reinforcing steel shall be taken 
into account by increasing the stress range in the reinforcing steel calculated under the 
assumption of perfect bond by the factor, 7], given by

where: 
o is the angle of concrete compression struts to the beam axis assumed in ULS design 
(see 6.2.3) 
6.8.3 Combination of actions 
(1)P For the calculation of the stress ranges the action shall be divided into non-cycling and 
fatigue-inducing cyclic actions (a number of repeated actions of load). 
(2)P The basic combination of the non-cyclic load is similar to the definition of the frequent 
combination for SLS: 
(6.66) 
The combination of actions in bracket {}, (called the basic combination), may be expressed as: 
:LG . "+" P "+" Q "+" :L'" .Q . k,J lfI1,1 k,1 't' 2,1 k,1 
j:2:1 i>1 (6.67) 
Note: Ok,1 and Ok,1 are non-cyclic, non-permanent actions 
(3)P The cyclic action shall be combined with the unfavourable basic combination:

The combination of actions in bracket { }, (called the basic combination plus the cyclic action), 
can be expressed as: 
("" G . n+n P "+" Q "+n"" .Q.J "+" Q L..,; k,J lfI1,1 k,1 L..,;lfI2" k,1 fat 
j 21 i>1 (6.69) 
where: 
Qfat is the relevant fatigue load (e.g. traffic load as defined in EN 1991 or other cyclic 
load) 
6.8.4 Veri'fication procedure for reinforcing and prestressing steel 
[¬ß) (1) The damage of a single stress range /1(5 may be determined by using the corresponding 
S-N curves (Figure 6.30) for reinforcing and prestressing steel. The applied load should be 
multiplied by /'F,fat. The resisting stress range at N* cycles ,dO"Rsk obtained should be divided 
by the safety factor YS,fat.

(2) For multiple cycles with variable amplitudes the damage may be added by using the 
Palmgren-Miner Rule. Hence, the fatigue damage factor OEd of steel caused by the relevant 
fatigue loads should satisfy the condition:

N(.dO"i) is the resisting number of cycles for a stress range .1O"j 
(3)P If prestressing or reinforcing steel is exposed to fatigue loads, the calculated stresses 
shall not exceed the design yield strength of the steel. 
(4) The yield strength should be verified by tensile tests for the steel used. 
(5) When the rules of 6.8 are used to evaluate the remaining life of existing structures, or to 
assess the need for strengthening, once corrosion has started the stress range may be 
determined by reducing the stress exponent k2 for straight and bent bars. 
Note: The value of k2 for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The recommended values is 5. 
(6)P The stress range of welded bars shall never exceed the stress range of straight and bent 
bars. 
6.8.5 Verification using damage equivalent stress range 
(1) Instead of an explicit verification of the damage strength according to 6.8.4 the fatigue 
verification of standard cases with known loads (railway and road bridges) may also be 
performed as follows: 
-by damage equivalent stress ranges for steel according to 6.8.5 (3) 
damage equivalent compression stresses for concrete according to 6.8.7 
(2) The method of damage equivalent stress range consists of representing the actual 
operational loading by N* cycles of a single stress range. EN 1992-2 gives relevant fatigue 
loading models and procedures for the calculation of the equivalent stress range LlO"S,equ for 
superstructures of road and railway bridges. 
(3) For reinforcing or prestressing steel and splicing devices adequate fatigue resistance 
should be assumed if the Expression (6.71) is satisfied:

and considering the number of loading cycles N*. For building construction 
LlO"s,equ(N*) may be approximated by Ll(Js,max .

SECTION 7 SERVICEABILITY LIMIT STATES (SLS) 
7.1 General 
(1)P This section covers the common serviceability limit states. These are: 
stress limitation (see 7.2) 
crack control (see 7.3) 
deflection control (see 7.4) 
Other limit states (such as vibration) may be of importance in particular structures but are not 
covered in this Standard. 
(2) In the calculation of stresses and deflections, cross-sections should be assumed to be 
uncracked provided that the flexural tensile stress does not exceed fct,eff. The value of fct,eff may 
be taken as fctm or fctm,l1 provided that the calculation for minimum tension reinforcement is also 
based on the same value. For the purposes of calculating crack widths and tension stiffening 
fctm should be used. 
7.2 Stress limitation 
(1)P The compressive stress in the concrete shall be limited in order to avoid longitudinal 
cracks, micro-cracks or high levels of creep, where they could result in unacceptable effects on 
the function of the structure. 
(2) Longitudinal cracks may occur if the stress level under the characteristic combination of 
loads exceeds a critical value. Such cracking may lead to a reduction of durability. In the 
absence of other measures, such as an increase in the cover to reinforcement in the 
compressive zone or confinement by transverse reinforcement, it may be appropriate to limit 
the compressive stress to a value k1fck in areas exposed to environments of exposure classes 
XD, XF and XS (see Table 4.1). 
Note: The value of k1 for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The recommended value is 0,6. 
(3) If the stress in the concrete under the quasi-permanent loads is less than k2fck' linear creep 
may be assumed. If the stress in concrete exceeds k2fck' non-linear creep should be 
considered (see 3.1.4) 
Note: The value of k2 for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The recommended value is 
0,45. 
(4)P Tensile stresses in the reinforcement shall be limited in order to avoid inelastic strain, 
unacceptable cracking or deformation. 
(5) ~ For the appearance unacceptable cracking or deformation @il may be assumed to be 
avoided if, under the characteristic combination of loads, the tensile strength in the reinforcement 
does not exceed k3fyk' Where the stress is caused by an imposed deformation, the tensile 
strength should not exceed k4fyk. The mean value of the stress in prestressing tendons should 
not exceed ksfyk. 
Note: The values of k3, k4 and k5 for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The 
recommended values are 0,8, 1 and 0,75 respectively.

7.3 C rack control 
7.3.1 General considerations 
(1)P Cracking shall be limited to an extent that will not impair the proper functioning or 
durability of the structure or cause its appearance to be unacceptable. 
(2) Cracking is normal in reinforced concrete structures subject to bending, shear, torsion or 
tension resulting from either direct loading or restraint or imposed deformations. 
(3) Cracks may also arise from other causes such as plastic shrinkage or expansive chemical 
reactions within the hardened concrete. Such cracks may be unacceptably large but their 
avoidance and control lie outside the scope of this Section. 
(4) Cracks may be permitted to form without any attempt to control their width, provided they 
do not impair the functioning of the structure. 
(5) ~ A lirniting value, wmax, for the calculated crack width, Wk, taking into account the 
proposed function and nature of the structure and the costs of limiting cracking, should be 
established. 
Note: The value of Wmax for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The recommended values 
for relevant exposure classes are given in Table 7.1 N.

Note 1: For XO, XC1 exposure classes, crack width has no influence on durability and 
~this limit is set to give generally acceptable appearance. In the absence @1] 
of appearance conditions this limit may be relaxed. 
I Note 2: For these exposure classes, in addition, decompression should be checked under the 
quasi-permanent combination of loads. 
In the absence of specific requirements (e.g. water-tightness), it may be assumed that limiting the calculated 
crack widths to the values of Wmax given in Table 7.1 N, under the quasi-permanent combination of loads, will 
generally be satisfactory for reinforced concrete members in buildings with respect to appearance and 
durability. 
The durability of prestressed members may be more critically affected by cracking. In the absence of more 
detailed requirements, it may be assumed that limiting the calculated crack widths to the values of Wmax given 
in Table 7.1 N, under the frequent combination of loads, will generally be satisfactory for prestressed concrete 
members. The decompression limit requires that all parts of the bonded tendons or duct lie at least 25 mm 
within concrete in compression. 
(6) For members with only unbonded tendons, the requirements for reinforced concrete 
elements apply. For members with a combination of bonded and unbonded tendons 
requirements for prestressed concrete members with bonded tendons apply.

(7) Special measures may be necessary for members subjected to exposure class XD3. The 
choice of appropriate measures will depend upon the nature of the aggressive agent involved. 
(8) When using strut-and-tie models with the struts oriented according to the compressive 
stress trajectories in the uncracked state, it is possible to use the forces in the ties to obtain the 
corresponding steel stresses to estinlate the crack width (see 5.6.4 (2). 
(9) Crack widths may be calculated according to 7.3.4. A simplified alternative is to linlit the bar 
size or spacing according to 7.3.3. 
7.3.2 Minimum reinforcenlent areas 
(1)P If crack control is required, a minimum amount of bonded reinforcement is required to 
control cracking in areas where tension is expected. The amount may be estimated from 
equilibrium between the tensile force in concrete just before cracking and the tensile force in 
reinforcement at yielding or at a lower stress if necessary to limit the crack width. 
(2) Unless a more rigorous calculation shows lesser areas to be adequate, the required 
minimum areas of reinforcement may be calculated as follows. In profiled cross sections like T¬≠
beams and box girders, minimum reinforcement should be determined for the individual parts of 
the section (webs, flanges). 
As,minO'"s = ke k fet,eff Aet (7.1 ) 
where: 
120 As,min is the minimum area of reinforcing steel within the tensile zone 
Aet is the area of concrete within tensile zone. The tensile zone is that part of the 
section which is calculated to be in tension just before formation of the first crack 
O'"s is the absolute value of the maximum stress permitted in the reinforcement 
immediately after formation of the crack. This may be taken as the yield strength 
of the reinforcement, fyk. A lower value may, however, be needed to satisfy the 
crack width limits according to the maximum bar size or spacing (see 7.3.3 (2)) 
fet,eff is the mean value of the tensile strength of the concrete effective at the time 
when the cracks may fi rst be expected to occu r: 
fet,eff = fetm or lower, (fetm(t)), if cracking is expected earlier than 28 days 
k is the coefficient which allows for the effect of non-uniform self-equilibrating 
stresses, which lead to a reduction of restraint forces 
= 1,0 for webs with h s; 300 mm or flanges with widths less than 300 mm 
= 0,65 for webs with h ~ 800 mm or flanges with widths greater than 800 mm 
intermediate values may be interpolated 
ke is a coefficient which takes account of the stress distribution within the section 
immediately prior to cracking and of the change of the lever arm: 
For pure tension ke = 1,0

(3) Bonded tendons in the tension zone may be assumed to contribute to crack control within a 
distance ~ 150 mm from the centre of the tendon. This may be taken into account by adding the 
term ~1Ap'L\(Jp to the left hand side of Expression (7.1), 
where 
Ap' is the area of pre or post-tensioned tendons within Ac,eff. 
Ac,eff is the effective area of concrete in tension surrounding the reinforcement or 
prestressing tendons of depth, hc,ef, where hc,ef is the lesser of 2,5(h-d), (h-x)/3 or

compressed or the absolute value of the tensile stress in the concrete is below (J ct,p'

7.3.3 Control of cracking without direct calculation 
(1) For reinforced or prestressed slabs in buildings subjected to bending without significant 
axial tension, specific measures to control cracking are not necessary where the overall depth 
does not exceed 200 mm and the provisions of 9.3 have been applied. 
(2) The rules given in 7.3.4 may be presented in a tabular form by restricting the bar diameter 
or spacing as a simplification. 
Note: Where the minimum reinforcement given by 7.3.2 is provided, crack widths are unlikely to be excessive 
if: 
122 for cracking caused dominantly by restraint, the bar sizes given in Table 7.2N are not exceeded where the 
steel stress is the value obtained immediately after cracking (i.e. 0"s in Expression (7.1)). 
for cracks caused mainly by loading, either the provisions of Table 7.2N or the provisions of Table 7.3N are 
complied with. The steel stress should be calculated on the basis of a cracked section under the relevant 
combination of actions.

For pre-tensioned concrete, where crack control is mainly provided by tendons with direct bond, Tables 7.2N 
and 7.3N may be used with a stress equal to the total stress minus prestress. For post-tensioned concrete, 
where crack control is provided mainly by ordinary reinforcement, the tables may be used with the stress in this 
reinforcement calculated with the effect of prestressing forces included.

(3) Beams with a total depth of 1000 mm or more, where the main reinforcement is 
concentrated in only a small proportion of the depth, should be provided with additional skin 
reinforcement to control cracking on the side faces of the beam. This reinforcement should be 
evenly distributed between the level of the tension steel and the neutral axis and should be 
located within the links. The area of the skin reinforcen1ent should not be less than the amount 
obtained from 7.3.2 (2) taking k as 0,5 and as as fyk. The spacing and size of suitable bars may 
be obtained from 7.3.4 ~ or a suitable simplification assurrling pure tension @il and a steel 
stress of half the value assessed for the main tension reinforcement. 
(4) It should be noted that there are particular risks of large cracks occurring in sections where 
there are sudden changes of stress, e.g. 
-at changes of section 
near concentrated loads 
positions where bars are curtailed 
-areas of high bond stress, particularly at the ends of laps 
Care should be taken at such areas to minimise the stress changes wherever possible. 
However, the rules for crack control given above will normally ensure adequate control at these 
points provided that the rules for detailing reinforcement given in Sections 8 and 9 are applied. 
(5) Cracking due to tangential action effects may be assumed to be adequately controlled if the 
detailing rules given in 9.2.2, 9.2.3, 9.3.2 and 9.4.3 are observed. @il 
7.3.4 Calculation of crack widths 
(1) The crack width, Wk, may be calculated from Expression (7.8): 
Wk = sr,max (8sm -8em) 
where 
Sr,max is the maximum crack spacing (7.8) 
8sm is the mean strain in the reinforcement under the relevant combination of loads, 
including the effect of imposed deformations and taking into account the effects of 
tension stiffening. Only the additional tensile strain beyond the state of zero strain 
of the concrete at the same level is considered 
8em is the mean strain in the concrete between cracks 
(2) 8sm -8em may be calculated fron1 the expression: 
k fct,eff (1 + a p ) as t e p,eff 
C" ___ --=--______ >_ 0,6 a s 
C.cm = Es Es Esm 
where: 
as is the stress in the tension reinforcement assuming a cracked section. For 
pretensioned men1bers, as may be replaced by b.ap the stress variation in 
prestressing tendons from the state of zero strain of the concrete at the same 
level.

Note: The values of k3 and k4 for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The recommended 
values are 3,4 and 0,425 respectively. 
Where the spacing of the bonded reinforcement exceeds 5(c+¬¢/2) (see Figure 7.2) or where 
there is no bonded reinforcement within the tension zone, an upper bound to the crack width 
may be found by assurrling a maximum crack spacing: 
Sr,max = 1,3 (h x) (7.14 ) 
(4) Where the angle between the axes of principal stress and the direction of the 
reinforcement, for members reinforced in two orthogonal directions, is significant (>15¬∞), then 
the crack spacing sr,max may be calculated from the following expression: 
1 
cosO o (7.15) Sr,max = 
Sr,max,y Sr,max,z 
where: 
e is the angle between the reinforcement in the y direction and the direction of the 
principal tensile stress 
Sr,max,y Sr,max,z are the crack spacings calculated in the y and z directions respectively, 
according to 7.3.4 (3) 
(5) For walls subjected to early thermal contraction where the horizontal steel area, As does not 
fulfil the requirements of 7.3.2 and where the bottom of the wall is restrained by a previously 
cast base, sr,max may be assumed to be equal to 1,3 times the height of the wall. 
Note: Where simplified methods of calculating crack width are used they should be based on the properties 
given in this Standard or substantiated by tests. 
7.4 Deflection control 
7.4.1 General considerations 
(1)P The deformation of a member or structure shall not be such that it adversely affects its 
proper functioning or appearance. 
(2) Appropriate limiting values of deflection taking into account the nature of the structure, of 
the finishes, partitions and fixings and upon the function of the structure should be established. 
(3) Deformations should not exceed those that can be accommodated by other connected 
elements such as partitions, glazing, cladding, services or finishes. In some cases limitation 
may be required to ensure the proper functioning of machinery or apparatus supported by the 
structure, or to avoid ponding on flat roofs. 
Note: The limiting deflections given in (4) and (5) below are derived from ISO 4356 and should generally 
result in satisfactory performance of buildings such as dwellings, offices, public buildings or factories. Care 
should be taken to ensure that the limits are appropriate for the particular structure considered and that that 
there are no special requirements. Further information on deflections and limiting values may be obtained from 
ISO 4356. 
(4) The appearance and general utility of the structure could be irrlpaired when the calculated 
sag of a beam, slab or cantilever subjected to quasi-permanent loads exceeds span/250. The 
sag is assessed relative to the supports. Pre-camber may be used to corrlpensate for some or 
126 

=== PAGE 129 ===

BS EN 1992-1-1:2004 
EN 1992-1-1:2004 (E) 
all of the deflection but any upward deflection incorporated in the formwork should not generally 
exceed span/250. 
(5) Deflections that could damage adjacent parts of the structure should be limited. For the 
deflection after construction, span/500 is normally an appropriate limit for quasi-permanent 
loads. Other limits may be considered, depending on the sensitivity of adjacent parts. 
(6) The limit state of deformation may be checked by either: 
-by limiting the span/depth ratio, according to 7.4.2 or 
-by comparing a calculated deflection, according to 7.4.3, with a limit value 
Note: The actual deformations may differ from the estimated values, particularly if the values of applied 
moments are close to the cracking moment. The differences will depend on the dispersion of the material 
properties, on the environmental conditions, on the load history, on the restraints at the supports, ground 
conditions, etc. 
7.4.2 Cases where calculations may be omitted 
(1)P Generally, it is not necessary to calculate the deflections explicitly as simple rules, for 
example limits to span/depth ratio may be formulated, which will be adequate for avoiding 
deflection problems in normal circumstances. More rigorous checks are necessary for members 
which lie outside such limits, or where deflection limits other than those implicit in simplified 
methods are appropriate. 
(2) Provided that reinforced concrete beams or slabs in buildings are dimensioned so that they 
comply with the limits of span to depth ratio given in this clause, their deflections may be 
considered as not exceeding the limits set out in 7.4.1 (4) and (5). The limiting span/depth ratio 
may be estimated using Expressions (7.16.a) and (7.16.b) and multiplying this by correction 
factors to allow for the type of reinforcement used and other variables. No allowance has been 
made for any pre-camber in the derivation of these Expressions.

Expressions (7.16.a) and (7 .16.b) have been derived on the assumption that the steel stress, 
under the appropriate design load at SLS at a cracked section at the mid-span of a beam or 
slab or at the support of a cantilever, is 310 MPa, (corresponding roughly to fyk = 500 MPa). 
127 

=== PAGE 130 ===

BS EN 1992-1-1:2004 
EN 1992-1-1:2004 (E) 
Where other stress levels are used, the values obtained using Expression (7.16) should be 
multiplied by 3101 as. It will nornlally be conservative to assume that: 
31 a I as = 500 I (fyk As,req I As,prov) 
where: (7.17) 
as is the tensile steel stress at mid-span (at support for cantilevers) under the design 
load at SLS 
As,prov is the area of steel provided at this section 
As,req is the area of steel required at this section for ultimate limit state 
For flanged sections where the ratio of the flange breadth to the rib breadth exceeds 3, the 
values of lid given by Expression (7.16) should be multiplied by 0,8. 
For beams and slabs, other than flat slabs, with spans exceeding 7 m, which support partitions 
liable to be damaged by excessive deflections, the values of lid given by Expression (7.16) 
should be multiplied by 7 I leff (left in metres, see 5.3.2.2 (1)). 
For flat slabs where the greater span exceeds 8,5 m, and which support partitions liable to be 
damaged by excessive deflections, the values of lid given by Expression (7.16) should be 
multiplied by 8,5 I left (left in metres). 
lEV Note: Values of K for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. Recommended values of K are 
given in Table 7AN. Values obtained using Expression (7.16) for common cases (C30/37, as= 310 MPa,

Note 1: The values given have been chosen to be generally conservative and calculation may frequently 
show that thinner members are possible. 
Note 2: For 2-way spanning slabs, the check should be carried out on the basis of the shorter span. For 
flat slabs the longer span should be taken. 
Note 3: The limits given for flat slabs correspond to a less severe limitation than a mid-span deflection of 
span/250 relative to the columns. Experience has shown this to be satisfactory. 
The values given by Expression (7.16) and Table 7AN have been derived from results of a parametric study 
made for a series of beams or slabs simply supported with rectangular cross section, using the general

approach given in 7.4.3. Different values of concrete strength class and a 500 MPa characteristic yield strength 
were considered. For a given area of tension reinforcement the ultimate moment was calculated and the quasi¬≠
permanent load was assumed as 50% of the corresponding total design load. The span/depth limits obtained 
satisfy the limiting deflection given in 7.4.1 (5). 
7.4.3 Checking deflections by calculation 
(1)P Where a calculation is deemed necessary, the deformations shall be calculated under 
load conditions which are appropriate to the purpose of the check. 
(2)P The calculation method adopted shall represent the true behaviour of the structure under 
relevant actions to an accuracy appropriate to the objectives of the calculation. 
(3) Members which are not expected to be loaded above the level which would cause the 
tensile strength of the concrete to be exceeded anywhere within the member should be 
considered to be uncracked. Members which are expected to crack, but may not be fully 
cracked, will behave in a manner intermediate between the uncracked and fully cracked 
conditions and, for members subjected mainly to flexure, an adequate prediction of behaviour is 
given by Expression (7.18): 
a = (all + (1 -() al (7.18) 
where 
a is the deformation parameter considered which may be, for example, a 
strain, a curvature, or a rotation. (As a simplification, a may also be taken as a

Table 3.1 indicates the range of likely values for tensile strength. In general, the best estimate 
of the behaviour will be obtained if {etm is used. Where it can be shown that there are no axial 
tensile stresses (e.g. those caused by shrinkage or thermal effects) the flexural tensile strength, 
{etm,tI, (see 3.1.8) may be used. 
(5) For loads with a duration causing creep, the total deformation including creep may be 
calculated by using an effective modulus of elasticity for concrete according to Expression 
(7.20): 
Eo,eff = 1 Er t ) (7.20) + qJ 00, 0 
where: 
rp( oo,to) is the creep coefficient relevant for the load and time interval (see 3.1.4) @11

where: 
1/rcs is the curvature due to shrinkage 
Ecs is the free shrinkage strain (see 3.1.4) 
S is the first moment of area of the reinforcement about the centroid of the section 
J is the second moment of area of the section 
ae is the effective modular ratio

Sand Jshould be calculated for the uncracked condition and the fully cracked condition, the 
final curvature being assessed by use of Expression (7.18). 
(7) The most rigorous method of assessing deflections using the method given in (3) above is 
to COITlpute the curvatures at frequent sections along the member and then calculate the 
deflection by numerical integration. In most cases it will be acceptable to compute the deflection 
twice, assuITling the whole member to be in the uncracked and fully cracked condition in turn, 
and then interpolate using Expression (7.18). 
Note: Where simplified methods of calculating deflections are used they should be based on the properties 
given in this Standard and substantiated by tests.

SECTION 8 DETAILING OF REINFORCEMENT AND PRESTRESSING TENDONS -
GENERAL 
8.1 General 
(1)P The rules given in this Section apply to ribbed reinforcement, mesh and prestressing 
tendons subjected predominantly to static loading. They are applicable for normal buildings and 
bridges. They may not be sufficient for: 
-elements subjected to dynamic loading caused by seismic effects or machine vibration, 
impact loading and 
-to elements incorporating specially painted, epoxy or zinc coated bars. 
Additional rules are provided for large diameter bars. 
(2)P The requirements concerning minimum concrete cover shall be satisfied (see 4.4.1.2). 
(3) For lightweight aggregate concrete, supplementary rules are given in Section 11. 
(4) Rules for structures subjected to fatigue loading are given in 6.8. 
8.2 Spacing of bars 
(1)P The spacing of bars shall be such that the concrete can be placed and compacted 
satisfactorily for the development of adequate bond. 
(2) The clear distance (horizontal and vertical) between individual parallel bars or horizontal 
layers of parallel bars should be not less than the maximum of k1 ¬∑bar diameter, (dg + k2 mm) or 
20 mm where dg is the maximum size of aggregate. 
Note: The value of k1 and k2 for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The recommended 
values are 1 and 5 mm respectively. 
(3) Where bars are positioned in separate horizontal layers, the bars in each layer should be 
located vertically above each other. There should be sufficient space between the resulting 
columns of bars to allow access for vibrators and good compaction of the concrete. 
(4) Lapped bars may be allowed to touch one another within the lap length. See 8.7 for more 
details. 
8.3 Permissible mandrel diameters for bent bars 
(1)P The minimum diameter to which a bar is bent shall be such as to avoid bending cracks in 
the bar, and to avoid failure of the concrete inside the bend of the bar. 
(2) In order to avoid damage to the reinforcement the diameter to which the bar is bent 
(Mandrel diameter) should not be less than ¬¢m,min. 
Note: The values of ¬¢m,min for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The recommended values 
are given in Table 8.1 N.

8.4 Anchorage of longitudinal reinforcement 
8.4.1 General 
(1)P Reinforcing bars, wires or welded mesh fabrics shall be so anchored that the bond forces 
are safely transrniUed to the concrete avoiding longitudinal cracking or spalling. Transverse 
reinforcement shall be provided if necessary.

(2) The anchorage should comply with Figure 8.5. Welding should be carried out in 
accordance with EN ISO 17660 and have a welding capacity in accordance with 8.6 (2).

(2) The anchorage capacity of one welded transverse bar (diameter 14 mm-32 mm), welded 
on the inside of the main bar, is Fbtd. O"sd in Expression (8.3) may then be reduced by Fbtd/Asl 
where As is the area of the bar. 
Note: The value of Fbtd for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The recommended value is 
determined from: 
Fbtd = ltd rA Old but not greater than FWd (S.SN) 
where: 
FWd is the design shear strength of weld (specified as a factor times As fyd: say 0.5 As fYd where As is the 
cross-section of the anchored bar and fyd is its design yield strength) 
137 

=== PAGE 140 ===

ltd is the design length of transverse bar: ltd = 1,16 ¬¢t (fydl otdt,5 ~ It 
It is the length of transverse bar, but not more than the spacing of bars to be anchored 
¬¢t is the diameter of transverse bar 
otd is the concrete stress; otd = (feld + ()cm)/Y ~ 3 fed 
()em is the compression in the concrete perpendicular to both bars (mean value, positive for compression) 
Y is a function: Y = 0,015 + 0,14 e(-O,18X) 
x is a function accounting for the geometry: x = 2 (cl ¬¢t) + 1 
c is the concrete cover perpendicular to both bars 
(3) If two bars of the same size are welded on opposite sides of the bar to be anchored, the 
capacity calculated from B.6 (2) may be doubled provided that the cover to the outer bar is in 
accordance with Section 4. 
(4) If two bars are welded to the same side with a minimum spacing of 3¬¢, the capacity should 
be multiplied by a factor of 1,41. 
(5) For nominal bar diameters of 12 mm and less, the anchorage capacity of a welded cross 
bar is mainly dependent on the design strength of the welded joint. It may be calculated as 
follows: 
(B.9) 
where: 
FWd design shear strength of weld (see B.6 (2)) 
rA nominal diameter of transverse bar: ¬¢t ~ 12 n1m 
r/>t nominal diameter of bar to anchor: ¬¢I ~ 12 mm 
~ If two welded cross bars with a minimum spacing of ¬¢t are used, the anchorage capacity 
given by Expression (B.9) should be multiplied by a factor of 1,41.@il 
8.7 Laps and mechanical couplers 
8.7.1 General 
(1)P Forces are transmitted from one bar to another by: 
-lapping of bars, with or without bends or hooks; 
-welding; 
-mechanical devices assuring load transfer in tension-compression or in compression only. 
8.7.2 Laps 
(1)P The detailing of laps between bars shall be such that: 
-the transmission of the forces from one bar to the next is assured; 
-spalling of the concrete in the neighbourhood of the joints does not occur; 
-large cracks which affect the petiormance of the structure do not occur. 
(2) Laps: 
between bars should normally be staggered and not located in areas of high moments 
Iforces (e.g. plastic hinges). Exceptions are given in (4) below; 
-at any section should normally be arranged symmetrically. 
(3) The arrangement of lapped bars should comply with Figure B.7: 
-the clear distance between lapped bars should not be greater than 4¬¢ or 50 mm, 
138 

=== PAGE 141 ===

BS EN 1992-1-1:2004 
EN 1992-1-1:2004 (E) 
otherwise the lap length should be increased by a length equal to the clear space where it 
exceeds 4¬¢ or 50 mm; 
-the longitudinal distance between two adjacent laps should not be less than 0,3 times the 
lap length, 10; 
-In case of adjacent laps, the clear distance between adjacent bars should not be less than 
2¬¢ or 20 mm. 
(4) When the provisions comply with (3) above, the permissible percentage of lapped bars in 
tension may be 100% where the bars are all in one layer. Where the bars are in several layers 
the percentage should be reduced to 50%. 
All bars in compression and secondary (distribution) reinforcement may be lapped in one 
section.

8.7.4 Transverse reinforcement in the lap zone 
8.7.4.1 Transverse reinforcement for bars in tension 
(1) Transverse reinforcement is required in the lap zone to resist transverse tension forces. 
(2) Where the diameter, ¬¢, of the lapped bars is less than 20 mm, or the percentage of lapped 
bars in any section is less than 25%), then any transverse reinforcement or links necessary for 
other reasons may be assumed sufficient for the transverse tensile forces without further 
justification. 
(3) Where the diameter, ¬¢, of the lapped bars is greater than or equal to 20 mm, the transverse 
~ reinforcement should have a total area, LAst (sum of all legs parallel to the layer of the spliced@j] 
reinforcement) of not less than the area As of one lapped bar (LAst ~ 1,OAs). The transverse bar 
should be placed perpendicular to the direction of the lapped reinforcement. 
If more than 50% of the reinforcement is lapped at one point and the distance, a, between 
adjacent laps at a section is s 1 O¬¢ (see Figure 8.7) transverse reinforcement should be formed 
by links or U bars anchored into the body of the section. 
(4) The transverse reinforcement provided for (3) above should be positioned at the outer 
sections of the lap as shown in Figure 8.9(a). 
8.7.4.2 Transverse reinforcenlent for bars permanently in compression 
(1) In addition to the rules for bars in tension one bar of the transverse reinforcement should be 
placed outside each end of the lap length and within 4¬¢ of the ends of the lap length (Figure 
8.9b).

(4) For layered fabric, the laps of the main reinforcement should generally be situated in zones 
where the calculated stress in the reinforcement at ultimate limit state is not more than 80% of 
the design strength. 
(5) Where condition (4) above is not fulfilled, the effective depth of the steel for the calculation 
of bending resistance in accordance with 6.1 should apply to the layer furthest from the tension 
face. In addition, when carrying out a crack-verification next to the end of the lap, the steel 
stress used in Tables 7.2 and 7.3 should be increased by 25% due to the discontinuity at the 
ends of the laps,. 
(6) The percentage of the main reinforcement, which may be lapped in anyone section, should 
comply with the following: 
For intermeshed fabric, the values given in Table 8.3 are applicable. 
For layered fabric the permissible percentage of the main reinforcement that may be spliced by 
lapping in any section, depends on the specific cross-section area of the welded fabric provided 
(Asls)prov , where s is the spacing of the wires: 
-1000/0 if (Asls)prov ~ 1200 mm2/m 
-60% if (Asls)prov > 1200 mm2/m. 
The joints of the multiple layers should be staggered by at least 1,3/0 (/0 is determined from 
8.7.3). 
(7) Additional transverse reinforcement is not necessary in the lapping zone. 
8.7.5.2 Laps of secondary or distribution reinforcement 
(1) All secondary reinforcement may be lapped at the same location. 
The minimum values of the lap length /0 are given in Table 8.4; the lap length of two secondary 
bars should cover two main bars.

8.8 Additional rules for large diameter bars 
(1) For bars with a diameter larger than ~arge the following rules supplement those given in 8.4 
and 8.7. 
Note: The value of ~arge for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The recommended value is 
32 mm.

(2) When such large diameter bars are used, crack control may be achieved either by using 
surface reinforcement (see 9.2.4) or by calculation (see 7.3.4). 
(3) Splitting forces are higher and dowel action is greater with the use of large diameter bars. 
Such bars should be anchored with mechanical devices. As an alternative they may be 
anchored as straight bars, but links should be provided as confining reinforcement. 
(4) Generally large diameter bars should not be lapped. Exceptions include sections with a 
~ minimum dimension 1,0 m or where the reinforcement stress is not greater than 80% of 
the design ultimate strength.@] 
(5) Transverse reinforcement, additional to that for shear, should be provided in the anchorage 
zones where transverse compression is not present. 
(6) For straight anchorage lengths (see Figure 8.11 for the notation used) the additional 
reinforcement referred to in (5) above should not be less than the following: 
in the direction parallel to the tension face: 
ASh = 0,25 As n1 
in the direction perpendicular to the tension face: 
Asv = 0,25 As n2 
where: 
As is the cross sectional area of an anchored bar, 
n1 is the number of layers with bars anchored at the same point in the menlber 
n2 is the number of bars anchored in each layer. (8.12) 
(8.13) 
(7) The additional transverse reinforcement should be uniformly distributed in the anchorage 
zone and the spacing of bars should not exceed 5 times the diameter of the longitudinal 
reinforcement.

(8) For surface reinforcement, 9.2.4 applies, but the area of surface reinforcement should not 
be less than 0,01 Act,ext in the direction perpendicular to large diameter bars, and 0,02 Act,ext

8.9 Bundled bars 
8.9.1 General 
(1) Unless otherwise stated, the rules for individual bars also apply for bundles of bars. In a 
bundle, all the bars should be of the same characteristics (type and grade). Bars of different 
sizes may be bundled provided that the ratio of diameters does not exceed 1,7. 
(2) In design, the bundle is replaced by a notional bar having the same sectional area and the 
same centre of gravity as the bundle. The equivalent diameter, r/Jn of this notional bar is such 
that: 
(8.14 ) 
where 
nb is the number of bars in the bundle, which is limited to: 
nb ::; 4 for vertical bars in compression and for bars in a lapped joint, 
nb ::; 3 for all other cases. 
(3) For a bundle, the rules given in 8.2 for spacing of bars apply. The equivalent diameter, r/Jr" 
should be used but the clear distance between bundles should be measured from the actual 
external contour of the bundle of bars. The concrete cover should be measured from the actual 
external contour of the bundles and should not be less than ¬¢no 
(4) Where two touching bars are positioned one above the other, and where the bond 
conditions are good, such bars need not be treated as a bundle. 
8.9.2 Anchorage of bundles of bars 
(1) Bundles of bars in tension may be curtailed over end and intermediate supports. Bundles 
with an equivalent diameter < 32 mm may be curtailed near a support without the need for 
staggering bars. Bundles with an equivalent dianleter ~ 32 mm which are anchored near a 
support should be staggered in the longitudinal direction as shown in Figure 8.12. 
(2) Where individual bars are anchored with a staggered distance greater than 1 ,3/b,rqd (where 
Ib,rqd is based on the bar diameter), the diameter of the bar may be used in assessing Ibd (see 
Figure 8.12). Otherwise the equivalent diameter of the bundle, tPn, should be used.

Figure 8.12: Anchorage of widely staggered bars in a bundle 
(3) For compression anchorages bundled bars need not be staggered. For bundles with an 
equivalent diameter ~ 32 mm, at least four links having a diameter 2: 12 IT"lm should be provided 
at the ends of the bundle. A further link should be provided just beyond the end of the curtailed 
bar.

8.9.3 Lapping bundles of bars BS EN 1992-1-1:2004 
EN 1992-1-1:2004 (E) 
(1) The lap length should be calculated in accordance with 8.7.3 using ¬¢n (from 8.9.1 (2)) as the 
equivalent diameter of bar. 
(2) For bundles which consist of two bars with an equivalent diameter < 32 mm the bars may 
be lapped without staggering individual bars. In this case the equivalent bar size should be 
used to calculate 10. 
(3) For bundles which consist of two bars with an equivalent diameter ~ 32 mm or of three bars, 
individual bars should be staggered in the longitudinal direction by at least 1,310 as shown in 
Figure 8.13, where 10 is based on a single bar. For this case bar NO.4 is used as the lapping 
bar. Care should be taken to ensure that there are not more than four bars in any lap cross 
section. Bundles of more than three bars should not be lapped.

8.10.1 Arrangement of prestressing tendons and ducts 
8.10.1.1 General 
(1)P The spacing of ducts or of pre-tensioned tendons shall be such as to ensure that placing 
and compacting of the concrete can be carried out satisfactorily and that sufficient bond can be 
attained between the concrete and the tendons. 
8.10.1.2 Pre-tensioned tendons 
(1) The minimum clear horizontal and vertical spacing of individual pre-tensioned tendons 
should be in accordance with that shown in Figure 8.14. Other layouts may be used provided 
that test results show satisfactory ultimate behaviour with respect to: 
-the concrete in compression at the anchorage 
-the spalling of concrete 
-the anchorage of pre-tensioned tendons 
-the placing of the concrete between the tendons. 
Consideration should also be given to durability and the danger of corrosion of the tendon at the 
end of elements.

8.10.2.1 General 
(1) In anchorage regions for pre-tensioned tendons, the following length parameters should be 
considered, see Figure 8.16:

distribution across the concrete section; see 8.10.2.2 (4),

8.10.2.2 Transfer of prestress 
(1) At release of tendons, the prestress may be assumed to be transferred to the concrete by a 
constant bond stress fbpt. where: 
fbpt = '7P 1 '71 fctd( t) 
where: (8.15) 
'7p1 is a coefficient that takes into account the type of tendon and the bond situation at 
release 
T/p1 = 2,7 for indented wires 
77p1 = 3,2 for 3 and 7-wire strands 
771 = 1,0 for good bond conditions (see 8.4.2) 
= 0,7 otherwise, unless a higher value can be justified with regard to special 
circumstances in execution 
~ fctd(t) is the design tensile value of strength at time of release; fctd(t) = act,O,7¬∑fctm(t) / Yc 
(see also 3.1.2 (9) and 3.1.6 (2)P) @11 
Note: Values of 'lp1 for types of tendons other than those given above may be used subject to a European 
Technical Approval 
(2) The basic value of the transmission length, Ipt, is given by: 
Ipt = a1 a2tP(Jpmolfbpt 
where: 
a1 = 1,0 for gradual release 
= 1,25 for sudden release 
a2 = 0,25 for tendons with circular cross section = 0,19 for 3 and 7 -wire strands 
tP is the nominal diameter of tendon 
(JpmO is the tendon stress just after release (8.16) 
(3) The design value of the transmission length should be taken as the less favourable of two

values, depending on the design situation: 
lpt1 0,8 lpt 
or 
lpt2 = 1,2 lpt 
Note: Normally the lower value is used for verifications of local stresses at release, the higher value for 
ultimate limit states (shear, anchorage etc.). 
(4) Concrete stresses may be assumed to have a linear distribution outside the dispersion 
~ length, see Figure 8.16: @il 
'diSp 
(5) Alternative build-up of prestress may be assumed, if adequately justified and if the 
transmission length is modified accordingly. 
~ 8.10.2.3 Anchorage of tendons for the ultimate limit state @il (8.17) 
(8.18) 
(8.19) 
(1) The anchorage of tendons should be checked in sections where the concrete tensile stress 
exceeds fctk,o,05. The tendon force should be calculated for a cracked section, including the 
~effect of shear according to 6.2.3 (7); see also 9.2.1.3. Where the concrete tensile stress is less @il 
than fctk,o,05, no anchorage check is necessary. 
(2) The bond strength for anchorage in the ultimate lirnit state is: 
fbpd = '7p2 171 fctd (8.20) 
where: 
1Jp2 is a coefficient that takes into account the type of tendon and the bond situation at 
anchorage 
17p2 = 1,4 for indented wires or 
1Jp2 = 1,2 for 7 -wire strands 
771 is as defined in 8.10.2.2 (1) 
Note: Values of '7p2 for types of tendons other than those given above may be used subject to a European 
Technical Approval. 
(3) Due to increasing brittleness with higher concrete strength, fctk,o,05 should here be limited to 
the value for C60/75, unless it can be verified that the average bond strength increases above 
this limit. 
(4) The total anchorage length for anchoring a tendon with stress O"pd is: 
'bpd = Ipt2 + a2r/J( O"pd -O"pmro)/f bpd 
where 
Ipt2 is the upper design value of transmission length, see 8.10.2.2 (3) 
a2 as defined in 8.10.2.2 (2) 
O"pd is the tendon stress corresponding to the force described in (1) 
o-pmro is the prestress after all losses 
(5) Tendon stresses in the anchorage zone are illustrated in Figure 8.17.

(6) In case of combined ordinary and pre-tensioned reinforcement, the anchorage capacities of 
each may be summed. 
8.10.3 Anchorage zones of post-tensioned members 
(1) The design of anchorage zones should be in accordance with the application rules given in 
this clause and those in 6.5.3. 
(2) When considering the effects of the prestress as a concentrated force on the anchorage 
zone, the design value of the prestressing tendons should be in accordance with 2.4.2.2 (3) and 
the lower characteristic tensile strength of the concrete should be used. 
(3) The bearing stress behind anchorage plates should be checked in accordance with the 
relevant European Technical Approval. 
(4) Tensile forces due to concentrated forces should be assessed by a strut and tie model, or 
other appropriate representation (see 6.5). Reinforcement should be detailed assuming that it 
acts at its design strength. If the stress in this reinforcement is limited to 300 MPa no check of 
crackwidths is necessary. 
(5) As a simplification the prestressing force may be assumed to disperse at an angle of spread 
2P (see Figure 8.18), starting at the end of the anchorage device, where p may be assumed to 
be arc tan 2/3.

8.10.4 Anchorages and couplers for prestressing tendons 
(1)P The anchorage devices used for post-tensioned tendons shall be in accordance with those 
specified for the prestressing system, and the anchorage lengths in the case of pre-tensioned 
tendons shall be such as to enable the full design strength of the tendons to be developed, 
taking account of any repeated, rapidly changing action effects. 
(2)P Where couplers are used they shall be in accordance with those specified for the 
prestressing system and shall be so placed -taking account of the interference caused by these 
devices -that they do not affect the bearing capacity of the member and that any temporary 
anchorage which may be needed during construction can be introduced in a satisfactory 
manner. 
(3) Calculations for local effects in the concrete and for the transverse reinforcement should be 
made in accordance with 6.5 and 8.10.3. 
(4) In general, couplers should be located away from intermediate supports. 
(5) The placing of couplers on 50% or more of the tendons at one cross-section should be 
avoided unless it can be shown that a higher percentage will not cause more risk to the safety 
of the structure. 
8.10.5 Deviators 
(1)P A deviator shall satisfy the following requirements: 
-withstand both longitudinal and transverse forces that the tendon applies to it and transmit 
these forces to the structure; 
-ensure that the radius of curvature of the prestressing tendon does not cause any 
overstressing or damage to it. 
(2)P In the deviation zones the tubes forming the sheaths shall b~ able to sustain the ~adial 
pressure and longitudinal movement of the prestressing tendon, Without damage and Without 
impairing its proper functioning.

(3)P The radius of curvature of the tendon in a deviation zone shall be in accordance with EN 
10138 and appropriate European Technical Approvals. 
(4) Designed tendon deviations up to an angle of 0,01 radians may be permitted without using 
a deviator. The forces developed by the change of angle using a deviator in accordance with 
the relevant European Technical Approval should be taken into account in the design 
calculations.

SECTION 9 DETAILING OF MEMBERS AND PARTICULAR RULES 
9.1 General 
(1)P The requirements for safety, serviceability and durability are satisfied by following the 
rules given in this section in addition to the general rules given elsewhere. 
(2) The detailing of members should be consistent with the design models adopted. 
(3) Minimum areas of reinforcement are given in order to prevent a brittle failure, wide cracks 
and also to resist forces arising from restrained actions. 
Note: The rules given in this section are mainly applicable to reinforced concrete buildings. 
9.2 Beams 
9.2.1 Longitudinal reinforcement 
9.2.1.1 Minimum and maximum reinforcement areas 
(1) The area of longitudinal tension reinforcement should not be taken as less than As,min. 
Note 1: See also 7.3 for area of longitudinal tension reinforcement to control cracking. 
Note 2: The value of As,min for beams for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The 
recommended value is given in the following: 
As,min 0,26 'rlm btd but not less than O,0013b td (9.1 N) 
yk 
Where: 
bt denotes the mean width of the tension zone; for a T-beam with the flange in compression, only the 
width of the web is taken into account in calculating the value of br 
fctm should be determined with respect to the relevant strength class according to Table 3.1. 
Alternatively, for secondary elements, where some risk of brittle failure may be accepted, As,min may be taken 
as 1,2 times the area required in ULS verification. 
(2) Sections containing less reinforcement than As,min should be considered as unreinforced 
(see Section 12). 
(3) The cross-sectional area of tension or compression reinforcement should not exceed As,max 
outside lap locations. 
Note: The value of As,max for beams for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The 
recommended value is O,04Ac. 
(4) For members prestressed with permanently unbonded tendons or with external prestressing 
cables, it should be verified that the ultimate bending capacity is larger than the flexural 
cracking moment. A capacity of 1,15 times the cracking moment is sufficient. 
9.2.1.2 Other detailing arrangements 
(1) In n10nolithic construction, even when simple supports have been assumed in design, the 
section at supports should be designed for a bending moment arising from partial fixity of at 
least fJ1 of the maximum bending nl0ment in the span.

recommended value is 0,15. 
Note 2: The minimum area of longitudinal reinforcement section defined in 9.2.1.1 (1) applies. 
(2) At intermediate supports of continuous beams, the total area of tension reinforcement As of 
a flanged cross-section should be spread over the effective width of flange (see 5.3.2). Part of it 
may be concentrated over the web width (See Figure 9.1). 
beff1 beff2 
Figure 9.1: Placing of tension reinforcement in flanged cross-section. 
(3) Any compression longitudinal reinforcement (diameter ¬¢) which is included in the resistance 
calculation should be held by transverse reinforcement with spacing not greater than 15¬¢. 
9.2.1.3 Curtailment of longitudinal tension reinforcement 
(1) Sufficient reinforcement should be provided at all sections to resist the envelope of the 
acting tensile force, including the effect of inclined cracks in webs and flanges. 
(2) For members with shear reinforcement the additional tensile force, i1Ftd, should be 
calculated according to 6.2.3 (7). For members without shear reinforcement i1Ftd may be 
estimated by shifting the moment curve a distance 81 = d according to 6.2.2 (5). This "shift rule" 
may also be used as an alternative for members with shear reinforcement, where: 
81 = z (cot 8-cot a)/2 (symbols defined in 6.2.3) (9.2) 
The additional tensile force is illustrated in Figure 9.2. 
(3) The resistance of bars within their anchorage lengths may be taken into account, assuming 
a linear variation of force, see Figure 9.2. As a conservative simplification this contribution may 
be ignored. 
(4) The anchorage length of a bent-up bar which contributes to the resistance to shear should 
be not less than 1,3 Ibd in the tension zone and 0,7 Ibd in the compression zone. It is measured 
from the point of intersection of the axes of the bent-up bar and the longitudinal reinforcement.

(1) The area of bottom reinforcement provided at end ¬Æ1 supports with little or no end fixity 
assumed in design, should be at least f32 of the area of steel provided in the span. 
Note: The value of /32 for beams for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The recommended 
value is 0,25.

according to the shift rule: 
where NEd is the axial force, to be added to or subtracted from the tensile force; al see 
9.2.1.3 (2). (9.3) 
(3) The anchorage length is Ibd according to 8.4.4, measured from the line of contact between 
beam and support. Transverse pressure may be taken into account for direct support. See 
Figure 9.3.

be provided and designed to resist the mutual reaction, This reinforcement is in addition to that 
required for other reasons, This rule also applies to a slab not supported at the top of a beam,

should be provided in one way slabs. In areas near supports transverse reinforcement to 
principal top bars is not necessary where there is no transverse bending moment 
(3) The spacing of bars should not exceed Smax,slabs. 
Note; The value of Smax,slabs for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The recommended value 
is: 
-for the principal reinforcement, 3h 400 mm, where h is the total depth of the slab;

-for the secondary reinforcement, 3,5h 450 mm . 
In areas with concentrated loads or areas of maximum moment those provisions become respectively:

for the secondary reinforcement, 3h :s 400 mm. 
(4) The rules given in 9.2.1.3 (1) to (3), 9.2.1.4 (1) to (3) and 9.2.1.5 (1) to (2) also apply but 
with al = d. 
9.3.1.2 Reinforcement in slabs near supports 
(1) In simply supported slabs, half the calculated span reinforcement should continue up to the 
support and be anchored therein in accordance with 8.4.4. 
Note: Curtailment and anchorage of reinforcement may be carried out according to 9.2.1.3, 9.2.1.4 and 
9.2.1.5. 
(2) Where partial fixity occurs along an edge of a slab, but is not taken into account in the 
analysis, the top reinforcement should be capable of resisting at least 25% of the maximum 
moment in the adjacent span. This reinforcement should extend at least 0,2 times the length of 
the adjacent span, measured from the face of the support. It should be continuous across 
internal supports and anchored at end supports. At an end support the moment to be resisted 
may be reduced to 15% of the maximum moment in the adjacent span. 
9.3.1.3 Corner reinforcement 
(1) If the detailing arrangements at a support are such that lifting of the slab at a corner is

9.4 Flat slabs 
9.4.1 Slab at internal columns (9.9) 
(9.10) 
(1) The arrangement of reinforcement in flat slab construction should reflect the behaviour 
under working conditions. In general this will result in a concentration of reinforcement over the 
columns. 
(2) At internal columns, unless rigorous serviceability calculations are carried out, top 
reinforcement of area 0,5 At should be placed in a width equal to the sum of 0,125 times the 
panel width on either side of the column. At represents the area of reinforcement required to

mm. A minimum of 3 bars evenly placed in the lap length is required. 
(5) Where the direction of the longitudinal bars changes, (e.g. at changes in column size), the 
spacing of transverse reinforcement should be calculated, taking account of the lateral forces 
involved. These effects may be ignored if the change of direction is less than or equal to 1 in 12. 
(6) Every longitudinal bar or bundle of bars placed in a corner should be held by transverse 
reinforcement. No bar within a compression zone should be further than 150 mm from a 
restrained bar. 
9.6 Walls 
9.6.1 General 
(1) This clause refers to reinforced concrete walls with a length to thickness ratio of 4 or more 
and in which the reinforcement is taken into account in the strength analysis. The amount and 
proper detailing of reinforcement may be derived from a strut-and-tie model (see 6.5). For walls

anchored for equilibrium in the node, see 6.5.4, by bending the bars, by using U-hoops or by 
anchorage devices, unless a sufficient length is available between the node and the end of the 
beam pernlitting an anchorage length of 'bd' 
9.8 Foundations 
9.8.1 Pile caps 
(1) The distance from the outer edge of the pile to the edge of the pile cap should be such that 
the tie forces in the pile cap can be properly anchored. The expected deviation of the pile on 
site should be taken into account. 
(2) Reinforcement in a pile cap should be calculated either by using strut-and-tie or flexural 
methods as appropriate. 
(3) The main tensile reinforcement to resist the action effects should be concentrated in the 
stress zones between the tops of the piles. A minimum bar diameter ¬¢min should be provided. 
If the area of this reinforcement is at least equal to the minimum reinforcement, evenly

top surface of the member may be unreinforced if there is no risk of tension developing in these 
parts of the member. 
Note: The value of ¬¢ min for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The recommended value is

R is the resultant of ground pressure within distance x 
is the external lever arm, i.e, distance between R and the vertical force NEd 
NEd is the vertical force corresponding to total ground pressure between sections A and 
B 
Zi is the internal lever arm, i.e, distance between the reinforcement and the horizontal 
force Fe 
Fe is the compressive force corresponding to maximum tensile force Fs,max 
(3) Lever arms Ze and Zi may be determined with regard to the necessary compression zones 
for NEd and Fe respectively, As simplifications, Ze may be determined assuming e = 0,15b, see 
Figure g, 13 and Zj may be taken as O,9d. 
(4) The available anchorage length for straight bars is denoted Ib in Figure 9,13. If this length is 
not sufficient to anchor Fs, bars may either be bent up to increase the available length or be 
provided with end anchorage devices. 
(5) For straight bars without end anchorage the minimum value of x is the most critical. As a 
simplification Xmin = hl2 may be assumed. For other types of anchorage, higher values of x may 
be more critical.

SECTION 10 ADDITIONAL RULES FOR PRECAST CONCRETE ELEMENTS AND 
STRUCTURES 
10.1 General 
(1)P The rules in this section apply to buildings made partly or entirely of precast concrete 
elements, and are supplementary to the rules in other sections. Additional matters related to 
detailing, production and assembly are covered by specific product standards. 
Note: Headings are numbered 10 followed by the number of the corresponding main section. Headings of 
lower level are numbered consecutively, without connection to sub-headings in previous sections. 
10.1.1 Special terms used in this section 
Precast element: element manufactured in a factory or a place other than the final position in 
the structure, protected from adverse weather conditions 
Precast product: precast element manufactured in compliance with a specific CEN standard 
Composite element: element comprising in-situ and precast concrete with or without 
reinforcenlent connectors 
Rib and block floor: consists of precast ribs (or beams) with an infill between them, made of 
blocks, hollow clay pots or other forms of permanent shuttering, with or without an in-situ 
topping 
Diaphragm: plane member which is subjected to in-plane forces; may consist of several precast 
units connected together 
Tie: in the context of precast structures, a ties is a tensile member, effectively continuous, 
placed in a floor, wall or column 
Isolated precast member: member for which, in case of failure, no secondary means of load 
transfer is available 
Transient situation in precast concrete construction includes 
demoulding 
transport to the storage yard 
storage (support and load conditions) 
transport to site 
erection (hoisting) 
construction (assembly) 
10.2 Basis of design, fundamental requirements 
(1)P In design and detailing of precast concrete elements and structures, the following shall be 
considered specifically: 
transient situations (see 10.1.1) 
bearings; temporary and permanent 
connections and joints between elements 
(2) Where relevant, dynamic effects in transient situations should be taken into account. In the 
absence of an accurate analysis, static effects may be multiplied by an appropriate factor (see 
also product standards for specific types of precast products). 
172 

=== PAGE 175 ===

BS EN 1992-1-1:2004 
EN 1992-1-1:2004 (E) 
(3) Where required, mechanical devices should be detailed in order to allow ease of assembly, 
inspection and replacement. 
10.3 Materials 
10.3.1 Concrete 
10.3.1.1 Strength 
(1) For precast products in continuous production, subjected to an appropriate quality control 
system according to the product standards, with the concrete tensile strength tested, a 
statistical analysis of test results may be used as a basis for the evaluation of the tensile 
strength that is used for serviceability limit states verifications, as an alternative to Table 3.1. 
(2) Intermediate strength classes within Table 3.1 may be used. 
(3) In the case of heat curing of precast concrete elements, the compressive strength of 
~ concrete at an age t before 28 days, fem(t) , may be estimated from Expression (3.1) in which the @lI 
concrete age t is substituted by the temperature adjusted concrete age obtained by Expression 
(B.1 0) of Annex B. 
Note: The coefficient /3cc(t) should be limited to 1. 
For the effect of heat curing Expression (10.1) may be used: 
(10.1) 
Where femp is the mean compressive strength after the heat curing (i.e. at the release of the 
prestress), measured by testing of samples at the time fp (tp < f), that went through the same 
heat treatment with the precast elements. 
10.3.1.2 Creep and shrinkage 
(1) In the case of a heat curing of the precast concrete elements, it is permitted to estimate the 
values of creep deformations according to the maturity function, Expression (B.1 0) of Annex B. 
(2) In order to calculate the creep deformations, the age of concrete at loading fa (in days) in 
Expression (B.5) should be replaced by the equivalent concrete age obtained by Expressions 
(B.9) and (B.1 0) of Annex B. 
(3) In precast elements subjected to heat curing it may be assumed that: 
a) the shrinkage strain is not significant during heat curing and 
b) autogenous shrinkage strain is negligible. 
10.3.2 Prestressing steel 
~ 10.3.2.1 Technological properties of prestressing steel @] 
(1)P For pre-tensioned members, the effect on the relaxation losses of increasing the 
temperature while curing the concrete, shall be considered. 
173 

=== PAGE 176 ===

BS EN 1992-1-1:2004 
EN 1992-1-1:2004 (E) 
Note: The relaxation is accelerated during the application of a thermal curing when a thermal strain is 
introduced at the same time. Finally, the relaxation rate is reduced at the end of the treatment. 
(2) An equivalent time teq should be added to the time after tensioning t in the relaxation time 
functions, given in 3.3.2(7), to cater for the effects of the heat treatment on the prestress loss 
due to the relaxation of the prestressing steel. The equivalent time can be estimated from 
Expression (10.2): 
(10.2) 
where 
teq is the equivalent time (in hours) 
T(~ti) is the temperature (in ¬∞C) during the time interval ~ti 
Tmax is the maximum temperature (in ¬∞C) during the heat treatment 
10.5 Structural analysis 
10.5.1 General 
(1)P The analysis shall account for: 
-the behaviour of the structural units at all stages of construction using the appropriate 
geometry and properties for each stage, and their interaction with other elements (e.g. 
conlposite action with in-situ concrete, other precast units); 
-the behaviour of the structural system influenced by the behaviour of the connections 
between elements, with particular regard to actual deformations and strength of 
connections; 
the uncertainties influencing restraints and force transmission between elements arising 
from deviations in geometry and in the positioning of units and bearings. 
(2) Beneficial effects of horizontal restraint caused by friction due to the weight of any 
supported element may only be used in non seismic zones (using rG,inf) and where: 
-the friction is not solely relied upon for overall stability of the structure; 
-the bearing arrangements preclude the possibility of accumulation of irreversible sliding of 
the elements, such as caused by uneven behaviour under alternate actions (e.g. cyclic 
thermal effects on the contact edges of simply supported elements); 
-the possibility of significant impact loading is eliminated 
(3) The effects of horizontal movements should be considered in design with respect to the 
resistance of the structure and the integrity of the connections. 
10.5.2 Losses of prestress 
(1) In the case of heat curing of precast concrete elements, the lessening of the tension in the 
tendons and the restrained dilatation of the concrete due to the temperature, induce a specific 
thermal loss ~Pe. This loss may be estimated by the Expression (10.3): 
fj, Pe 0,5 A p ac (Tmax To) 
Where 
174 Ap 
E p is the cross-section of tendons 
is the elasticity modulus of tendons (10.3) 

=== PAGE 177 ===

BS EN 1992-1-1:2004 
EN 1992-1-1:2004 (E) 
IEl) ac is the linear coefficient of thermal expansion for concrete (see 3.1.3(5)) @il 
Tmax -To is the difference between the maximunl and initial temperature in the concrete 
near the tendons, in ¬∞C 
Note: Any loss of prestress, I1Pe, caused by elongation due to heat curing may be ignored if preheating of the 
tendons is applied. 
10.9 Particular rules for design and detailing 
10.9.1 Restraining moments in slabs 
(1) Restraining moments may be resisted by top reinforcement placed in the topping or in plugs 
in open cores of hollow core units. In the former case the horizontal shear in the connection 
should be checked according to 6.2.5. In the latter case the transfer of force between the in situ 
concrete plug and the hollow core unit should be verified according to 6.2.5. The length of the 
top reinforcement should be in accordance with 9.2.1.3. 
(2) Unintended restraining effects at the supports of simply supported slabs should be 
considered by special reinforcement and/or detailing. 
10.9.2 Wall to floor connections 
(1) In wall elements installed over floor slabs, reinforcement should normally be provided for 
possible eccentricities and concentrations of the vertical load at the end of the wall. For floor 
elements see 10.9.1 (2). 
(2) No specific reinforcement is required provided the vertical load per unit length is ~ 0,5h.fcd, 
where h is the wall thickness, see Figure 10.1. The load may be increased to 0,6h.fcd with 
reinforcement according to Figure 10.1, having diameter t/J ~ 6 mm and spacing s not greater 
than the lesser of hand 200 mm. For higher loads, reinforcement should be designed according 
to (1). A separate check should be made for the lower wall.

10.9.3 Floor systems 
(1)P The detailing of floor systems shall be consistent with assumptions in analysis and design. 
Relevant product standards shall be considered. 
175

BS EN 1992-1-1:2004 
EN 1992-1-1:2004 (E) 
(2)P Where transverse load distribution between adjacent units has been taken into account, 
appropriate shear connection shall be provided. 
(3)P The effects of possible restraints of precast units shall be considered, even if simple 
supports have been assumed in design. 
(4) Shear transfer in connections may be achieved in different ways. Three main types of 
connections shown in Figure 10.2. 
(5) Transverse distribution of loads should be based on analysis or tests, taking into account 
possible load variations between precast elements. The resulting shear force between floor 
units should be considered in the design of connections and adjacent parts of elements (e.g. 
outside ribs or webs). 
For floors with uniformly distributed load, and in the absence of a more accurate analysis, this 
shear force per unit length may be taken as: 
(10.4) 
where: 
qEd 
be is the design value of variable load (kN/m2) 
is the width of the element 
a) concreted or grouted 
connections b) welded or bolted 
connections (this shows 
one type of welded 
connection as an 
example) c) reinforced topping. 
(vertical reinforcement 
connectors to topping may 
be required to ensure 
shear transfer at U LS) 
Figure 10.2: Examples of connections for shear transfer 
(6) Where precast floors are assumed to act as diaphragms to transfer horizontal loads to 
bracing units, the following should be considered: 
the diaphragm should form part of a realistic structural model, taking into account the 
deformation compatibility with bracing units, 
the effects of horizontal deformations should be taken into account for all parts of the 
structure involved in the transfer of horizontal loads, 
the diaphragm should be reinforced for the tensile forces assumed in the structural 
model, 
stress concentrations at openings and connections should be taken into account in the 
detailing of reinforcement. 
(7) Transverse reinforcement for shear transfer across connections in the diaphragm may be 
concentrated along supports, fornling ties consistent with tile structural model. This 
reinforcement may be placed in the topping, if it exists. 
176 

=== PAGE 179 ===

BS EN 1992-1-1:2004 
EN 1992-1-1:2004 (E) 
(8) Precast units with a topping of at least 40 mm may be designed as composite members, if 
shear in the interface is verified according to 6.2.5. The precast unit should be checked at all 
stages of construction, before and after composite action has become effective. 
(9) Transverse reinforcement for bending and other action effects may lie entirely within the 
topping. The detailing should be consistent with the structural model, e.g. if two-way spanning is 
assumed. 
(10) Webs or ribs in isolated slab units (i.e. units which are not connected for shear transfer) 
should be provided with shear reinforcement as for beams. 
(11) Floors with precast ribs and blocks without topping may be analysed as solid slabs, if the 
insitu transverse ribs are provided with continuous reinforcement through the precast 
longitudinal ribs and at a spacing ST according to Table 10.1. 
(12) In diaphragm action between precast slab elements with concreted or grouted 
connections, the average longitudinal shear stress VRdi should be limited to 0,1 MPa for very 
smooth surfaces, and to 0,15 IVIPa for smooth and rough surfaces. See 6.2.5 for definition of 
surfaces. 
Table 10.1: Maximum spacing of transverse ribs, ST for the analysis of floors with 
ribs and block as solid slabs. SL = spacing of longitudinal ribs, IL = 
length (span) of longitudinal ribs, h = thickness of ribbed floor 
Type of imposed loading SL ::;; IL/8 
Residential, snow not required 
Other ST::;; 10 h 
10.9.4 Connections and supports for precast elements 
10.9.4.1 Materials 
(1)P Materials used for connections shall be: 
-stable and durable for the design working life of the structure 
chemically and physically compatible 
protected against adverse chemical and physical influences 
-fire resistant to match the fire resistance of the structure. SL > IL/8 
ST 12 h 
ST ::;; 8h 
(2)P Supporting pads shall have strength and deformation properties in accordance with the 
design assumptions. 
(3)P Metal fastenings for claddings, other than in environmental classes XO and XC1 (Table 
4.1) and not protected against the environment, shall be of corrosion resistant material. If 
inspection is possible, coated material may also be used. 
(4)P Before undertaking welding, annealing or cold forming the suitability of the material shall 
be verified. 
177

BS EN 1992-1-1:2004 
EN 1992-1-1:2004 (E) 
10.9.4.2 General rules for design and detailing of connections 
(1)P Connections shall be able to resist action effects consistent with design assumptions, to 
accommodate the necessary deformations and ensure robust behaviour of the structure. 
(2)P Premature splitting or spalling of concrete at the ends of elements shall be prevented, 
taking into account 
relative movements between elements 
-deviations 
-assembly requirements 
ease of execution 
-ease of inspection 
(3) Verification of resistance and stiffness of connections may be based on analysis, possibly 
assisted by testing (for design assisted by testing, see EN 1990, Annex D). Imperfections 
should be taken into account. Design values based on tests should allow for unfavourable 
deviations from testing conditions. 
10.9.4.3 Connections transmitting compressive forces 
(1) Shear forces may be ignored in compression connections if they are less than 10010 of the 
compressive force. 
(2) For connections with bedding materials like mortar, concrete or polymers, relative 
nl0venlent between the connected surfaces should be prevented during hardening of the 
material. 
(3) Connections without bedding material (dry connections) should only be used where an 
appropriate quality of workmanship can be achieved. The average bearing stress between 
plane surfaces should not exceed 0,3 fed. Dry connections including curved (convex) surfaces 
should be designed with due consideration of the geometry. 
(4) Transverse tensile stresses in adjacent elements should be considered. They may be due 
to concentrated compression according to Figure 10.3a, or to the expansion of soft padding 
according to Figure 10.3b. Reinforcement in case a) may be designed and located according to 
6.5. Reinforcement in case b) should be placed close to the surfaces of the adjacent elements. 
(5) In the absence of more accurate models, reinforcement in case b) may be calculated in 
accordance with Expression (10.5): 
As = 0,25 (t / h) FEd / fyd 
where: 
As is the reinforcement area in each surface 
t is the thickness of padding 
h is the dimension of padding in direction of reinforcement 
FEd is the compressive force in connection. (10.5) 
(6) The maximum capacity of compression connections can be determined according to 6.7, or 
can be based on analysis, possibly assisted by testing (for design assisted testing, see EN 
1990).

concrete, see 6.2.5. 
10.9.4.5 Connections transmitting bending moments or tensile forces 
(1)P Reinforcement shall be continuous across the connection and anchored in the adjacent 
elements.

overlapping reinforcement loops 
welding of bars or steel plates 
prestressi ng 
nlechanical devices (threaded or filled sleeves) 
swaged connectors (compressed sleeves) 
10.9.4.6 Half joints 
(1) Half joints may be designed using strut-and-tie models according to 6.5. Two alternative 
models and reinforcements are indicated in Figure 10.4. The two models may be combined. 
Note: The figure shows only the main features of strut-and-tie models.

10.9.5 Bearings 
10.9.5.1 General 
(1)P The proper functioning of bearings shall be ensured by reinforcement in adjacent 
members, limitation of bearing stress and measures to account for movement or restraint. 
(2)P For bearings which do not permit sliding or rotation without significant restraint, actions 
due to creep, shrinkage, temperature, misalignment, lack of plumb etc. shall be taken into 
account in the design of adjacent members. 
(3) The effects of (2)P may require transverse reinforcement in supporting and supported 
members, and/or continuity reinforcement for tying elements together. They may also influence 
the design of main reinforcement in such members. 
(4)P Bearings shall be designed and detailed to ensure correct positioning, taking into account 
production and assembling deviations. 
(5)P Possible effects of prestressing anchorages and their recesses shall be taken into 
account. 
10.9.5.2 Bearings for connected (non-isolated) members 
(1) The nominal length a of a simple bearing as shown in Figure 10.6 may be calculated as: 
(10.6) 
where: 
a1 is the net bearing length with regard to bearing stress, a1 = FEd / (b1 fRd), but not 
less than minimum values in Table 10.2 
FEd is the design value of support reaction 
b1 is the net bearing width, see (3)

(2) In the absence of other specifications, the following values can be used for the bearing 
strength: 
fRd = 0,4 fed for dry connections (see 10.9.4.3 (3) for definition) 
for all other cases 
where 
fed is the the lower of the design strengths for suppol1ed and supporting member 
fbed is the design strength of bedding material 
(3) If measures are taken to obtain a uniform distribution of the bearing pressure, e.g. with 
mortar, neoprene or similar pads, the design bearing width b1 may be taken as the actual width 
of the bearing. Otherwise, and in the absence of a more accurate analysis, b1 should not be 
greater than to 600 mm. 
10.9.5.3 Bearings for isolated members 
(1)P The nonlinallength shall be 20 mm greater than for non-isolated members. 
(2)P If the bearing allows movements in the support, the net bearing length shall be increased 
to cover possible movements. 
(3)P If a member is tied other than at the level of its bearing, the net bearing length a1 shall be 
increased to cover the effect of possible rotation around the tie. 
10.9.6 Pocket foundations 
10.9.6.1 General 
(1)P Concrete pockets shall be capable of transferring vertical actions, bending moments and 
horizontal shears from columns to the soil. The pocket shall be large enough to enable a good 
concrete filling below and around the colun-In. 
10.9.6.2 Pockets with keyed surfaces 
(1) Pockets expressly wrought with indentations or keys may be considered to act 
monolithically with the column. 
(2) Where vertical tension due to moment transfer occurs careful detailing of the overlap 
reinforcement of the similarly wrought column and the foundation is needed, allowing for the 
~ separation of the lapped bars. The lap length according to 8.7 should be increased by at least 
the horizontal distance between bars in the column and in the foundation (see Figure 10.7 (a) ) 
Adequate horizontal reinforcement for the lapped splice should be provided. 
(3) The punching shear design should be as for monolithic column/foundation connections 
according to 6.4, as shown in Figure 10.7 (a), provided the shear transfer between the colurTin 
and footing is verified. Otherwise the punching shear design should be as for pockets with 
smooth surfaces.

10.9.6.3 Pockets with smooth surfaces 
(1) The forces and the moment may be assumed to be transferred from column to foundation 
by compressive forces F1, F2 and F3 through the concrete filling and corresponding friction 
forces, as shown in Figure 10.7 (b). This model requires 
1?1,2h.

(2) The coefficient of friction should not be taken greater than fL = 0,3. 
(3) Special attention should be paid to: 
detailing of reinforcement for F1 in top of pocket walls 
transfer of F1 along the lateral walls to the footing 
anchorage of main reinforcement in the column and pocket walls 
shear resistance of column within the pocket 
punching resistance of the footing slab under the column force, the calculation for which may 
take into account the insitu structural concrete placed under the precast element. 
10.9.7 Tying systems 
(1) For plate elements loaded in their own plane, e.g. in walls and floor diaphragms, the 
necessary interaction may be obtained by tying the structure together with peripheral and/or 
internal ties. 
The same ties may also act to prevent progressive collapse according to 9.10.

SECTION 11 LIGHTWEIGHT AGGREGATE CONCRETE STRUCTURES 
11.1 General 
(1)P This section provides additional requirements for lightweight aggregate concrete (LWAC). 
Reference is made to the other Sections (1 to 10 and 12) of this document and the Annexes. 
Note. Headings are numbered 11 followed by the number of the corresponding main section. Headings of 
lower level are numbered consecutively, without connection to sub-headings in previous sections. If 
alternatives are given for Expressions, Figures or Tables in the other sections, the original reference numbers 
are also prefixed by 11. 
11.1.1 Scope 
(1)P All clauses of the Sections 1 to 10 and 12 are generally applicable, unless they are 
substituted by special clauses given in this section. In general, where strength values 
originating from Table 3.1 are used in Expressions, those values have to be replaced by the 
corresponding values for lightweight concrete, given in this section in Table 11.3.1. 
(2)P Section 11 applies to all concretes with closed structure made with natural or artificial 
mineral lightweight aggregates, unless reliable experience indicates that provisions different 
from those given can be adopted safely. 
(3) This section does not apply to aerated concrete either autoclaved or nornlally cured nor 
lightweight aggregate concrete with an open structure. 
(4)P Lightweight aggregate concrete is concrete having a closed structure and a density of not 
more than 2200 kg/m3 consisting of or containing a proportion of artificial or natural lightweight 
aggregates having a particle density of less than 2000 kg/m3 
11.1.2 Special symbols 
1 (P) The following symbols are used specially for lightweight concrete: 
LC the strength classes of lightweight aggregate concrete are preceded by the symbol LC 
17E is a conversion factor for calculating the modulus of elasticity 
171 is a coefficient for determining tensile strength 
1]2 is a coefficient for determining creep coefficient 
'73 is a coefficient for determining drying shrinkage 
p is the oven-dry density of lightweight aggregate concrete in kg/n13 
For the mechanical properties an additional subscript I (lightweight) is used. 
11.2 Basis of design 
1 (P) Section 2 is valid for lightweight concrete without modifications.

11.3 Materials 
11.3.1 Concrete 
(1)P In EN 206-1 lightweight aggregate IRi) concrete @] is classified according to its density 
as shown in Table 11.1. In addition this table gives corresponding densities for plain and 
reinforced concrete with normal percentages of reinforcement which may be used for design 
purposes in calculating self-weight or imposed permanent loading. Alternatively, the density may 
be specified as a taget value. 
(2) Alternatively the contribution of the reinforcement to the density may be determined by 
calculation. 
Table 11.1: Density classes and corresponding design densities of LWAC 
according to EN 206-1 
Density class 1,0 1,2 1,4 1,6 1,8 2,0 I 
Density (kg/m3) 801-1001-1201-1401-1601 1801 
1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 2000 
Density I Plain concrete 1050 1250 1450 1650 1850 2050 
. (kg/m3) I Reinforced concrete 1150 1350 1550 1750 1950 2150 
(3) The tensile strength of lightweight aggregate concrete may be obtained by multiplying the tet 
values given in Table 3.1 by a coefficient: 
171 = 0,40 + O,60p12200 (11.1) 
where 
~ p is the upper limit of the oven dry density for the relevant class in accordance with Table 11.1 @il 
11.3.2 Elastic deformation 
(1) An estimate of the mean values of the secant modulus E1em for LWAC may be obtained by 
multiplying the values in Table 3.1, for normal density concrete, by the following coefficient: 
17E = (pI2200)2 ( 11.2) 
where p denotes the oven-dry density in accordance with EN 206-1 Section 4 (see Table 
11.1 ). 
Where accurate data are needed, e.g. where deflections are of great importance, tests should 
be carried out in order to determine the Elem values in accordance with ISO 6784. 
Note: A Country's National Annex may refer to non-contradictory complementary information. 
(2) The coefficient of thermal expansion of LWAC depends mainly on the type of aggregate 
used and varies over a wide range between about 4.10-6 and 14¬∑10-6/K 
For design purposes where thermal expansion is of no great importance, the coefficient of 
thernlal expansion may be taken as 8.10-6 IK. 
The differences between the coefficients of thermal expansion of steel and lightweight 
aggregate concrete need not be considered in design.

11.3.3 Creep and shrinkage 
(1) For lightweight aggregate concrete the creep coefficient if' may be assumed equal to the 
value of normal density concrete multiplied by a factor (pI2200)2. 
The creep strains so derived should be multiplied by a factor, 7]2, given by 
7]2 = 1,3 for ~ek :s; LC 16/18 
= 1,0 for ~ek 2:: LC20/22 
(2) The final drying shrinkage values for lightweight concrete can be obtained by multiplying the 
values for normal density concrete in Table 3.2 by a factor, 7]3, given by 
7]3 = 1,5 for ~ek :s; LC16/18 
= 1,2 for ~ek 2:: LC20/22 
(3) The Expressions (3.11), (3.12) and (3.13), which provide information for autogenous 
shrinkage, give maximum values for lightweight aggregate concretes, where no supply of water 
from the aggregate to the drying rrlicrostructure is possible. If water-saturated, or even partially 
saturated lightweight aggregate is used, the autogenous shrinkage values will be considerably 
reduced. 
11.3.4 Stress-strain relations for non-linear structural analysis

0,85. 
11.3.6 Stress-strain relations for the design of sections

SECTION 12 PLAIN AND LIGHTLY REINFORCED CONCRETE STRUCTURES 
12.1 General 
(1)P This section provides additional rules for plain concrete structures or where the 
reinforcement provided is less than the minimum required for reinforced concrete. 
Note: Headings are numbered 12 followed by the number of the corresponding main section. Headings of lower 
level are numbered consecutively, without reference to subheadings in previous sections. 
(2) This section applies to members, for which the effect of dynamic actions may be ignored. It 
does not apply to the effects such as those from rotating machines and traffic loads. Examples 
of such mernbers include: 
-members mainly subjected to compression other than that due to prestressing, e.g. walls, 
columns, arches, vaults, and tunnels; 
-strip and pad footings for foundations; 
-retaining walls; 
piles whose diameter is 2:: 600 mm and where NEd/Ac:S; O,3fck. 
(3) Where members are made with lightweight aggregate concrete with closed structure 
according to Section 11 or for precast concrete elements and structures covered by this 
Eurocode, the design rules should be modified accordingly. 
(4) Members using plain concrete do not preclude the provision of steel reinforcement needed 
to satisfy serviceability and/or durability requirements, nor reinforcement in certain parts of the 
members. This reinforcement may be taken into account for the verification of local ultimate Iin"lit 
states as well as for the checks of the serviceability limit states. 
12.3 Materials 
12.3.1 Concrete: additional design assumptions 
(1) Due to the less ductile properties of plain concrete the values for acc,pl and act, pi should be 
taken to be less than ace and act for reinforced concrete. 
Note: The values of acc,pl and act, pi for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The 
recommended value for both is 0,8. 
(2) When tensile stresses are considered for the design resistance of plain concrete members, 
the stress strain diagram (see 3.1.7) may be extended up to the tensile design strength using 
Expression (3.16) or a linear relationship. 
~ fctd,pl = act, pi fctk,o,05/ Yc (12.1) 
(3) Fracture mechanic methods may be used provided it can be shown that they lead to the 
required level of safety. 
12.5 Structural analysis: ultimate limit states 
(1) Since plain concrete menlbers have limited ductility, linear analysis with redistribution or a 
plastic approach to analysis, e.g. methods without an explicit check of the deformation capacity, 
should not be used unless their application can be justified. 
193 

=== PAGE 196 ===

BS EN 1992-1-1:2004 
EN 1992-1-1:2004 (E) 
(2) Structural analysis may be based on the non-linear or the linear elastic theory. In the case 
of a non-linear analysis (e.g. fracture mechanics) a check of the deformation capacity should be 
carried out. 
12.6 Ultimate limit states 
12.6.1 Design resistance to bending and axial force 
(1) In the case of walls, subject to the provision of adequate construction details and curing, 
the imposed deformations due to temperature or shrinkage may be ignored. 
(2) The stress-strain relations for plain concrete should be taken from 3.1.7. 
(3) The axial resistance, NRd, of a rectangular cross-section with a uniaxial eccentricity, e, in 
the direction of hw, may be taken as: 
~ NRd = rlcd,pl x b x hw x (1-2elhw) @il 
where: 
~ rlcd,pl is the design effective compressive strength (see 3.1.7 (3) @il 
b is the overall width of the cross-section (see Figure 12.1) 
hw is the overall depth of the cross-section 
e is the eccentricity of NEd in the direction hw. (12.2) 
Note: Where other simplified methods are used they should not be less conservative than a rigorous method 
using a stress-strain relationship given in 3.1.7. 
Figure 12.1: Notation for plain walls 
12.6.2 Local failure 
(1)P Unless measures to avoid local tensile failure of the cross-section have been taken, the 
maximunl eccentricity of the axial force NEd in a cross-section shall be limited to avoid large 
cracks.

BS EN 1992-1-1:2004 
EN 1992-1-1:2004 (E) 
12.6.3 Shear 
(1) In plain concrete members account may be taken of the concrete tensile strength in the 
ultimate limit state for shear, provided that either by calculations or by experience brittle failure 
can be excluded and adequate resistance can be ensured. 
(2) For a section subject to a shear force VEd and a normal force NEd acting over a compressive 
area Ace the absolute value of the components of design stress should be taken as: 
(12.3) 
(12.4 ) 
Note: the value of k for use in a Country may be found in its National Annex. The recommended value is 1,5. 
and the following should be checked:

fed, pi is the concrete design strength in compression 
fctd, pi is concrete design strength in tension @il (12.5) 
(12.6)

(3) A concrete member may be considered to be uncracked in the ultimate limit state if either it 
remains completely under compression or if the absolute value of the principal concrete tensile 
IE.1) stress O"ct1 does not exceed fetd,PI. @il 
12.6.4 Torsion 
(1) Cracked members should not normally be designed to resist torsional moments unless it 
can be justified otherwise.

Note: The information in Table 12.1 assumes that the wall has no openings with a height exceeding 1/3 of the 
wall height Iw or with an area exceeding 1/10 of the wall area. In walls laterally restrained along 3 or 4 sides with 
openings exceeding these limits, the parts between the openings should be considered as laterally restrained 
along 2 sides only and be designed accordingly. 
(2) The ,8-values should be increased appropriately if the transverse bearing capacity is affected 
by chases or recesses.

(3) A transverse wall may be considered as a bracing wall if: 
-its total depth is not less than 0,5 hw, where hw is the overall depth of the braced wall; 
-it has the same height Iw as the braced wall under consideration; 
-its length Iht is at least equal to Iw I 5, where Iw denotes the clear height of the braced wall; 
lEV -within the length lw 15 the transverse wall has no.openings.@Z] 
(4) In the case of a wall connected along the top and bottom in flexurally rigid manner by 
insitu concrete and reinforcenlent, so that the edge moments can be fully resisted, the values 
for f3 given in Table 12.1 may be factored by 0,85. 
(5) The slenderness of walls in plain concrete cast insitu should generally not exceed A = 86 
(Le. lolhw = 25). 
12.6.5.2 Simplified design method for walls and columns 
(1) In absence of a more rigorous approach, the design resistance in terms of axial force for 
a slender wall or column in plain concrete may be calculated as follows: 
~ NRd = b x hw x fcd,pl x (/J @il 
where 
NRd is the axial resistance 
b is the overall width of the cross-section 
hw is the overall depth of the cross-section (12.10) 
(/J Factor taking into account eccentricity, including second order effects and nornlal 
effects of creep; see below 
For braced members, the factor (/J may be taken as: 
~ Q) = 1,14 x (1-2etotfhw) -0,02 x lolhw ~ (1-2 etotlhw) 
where: 
etot eo + ej (12.11) 
(12.12) 
eo is the first order eccentricity including, where relevant, the effects of floors (e.g. 
possible clamping moments transmitted to the wall from a slab) and horizontal actions 
ej is the additional eccentricity covering the effects of geometrical imperfections, see 5.2 
(2) Other simplified methods may be used provided that they are not less conservative than 
a rigorous method in accordance with 5.8. 
12.7 Serviceability limit states 
(1) Stresses should be checked where structural restraint is expected to occur. 
(2) The following measures to ensure adequate serviceability should be considered: 
a) with regard to crack formation: 
-limitation of concrete tensile stresses to acceptable values; 
provision of subsidiary structural reinforcement (surface reinforcement, tying system where 
necessary); 
-provision of joints; 
-choice of concrete technology (e.g. appropriate concrete composition, curing); 
-choice of appropriate method of construction.

b) with regard to lirnitation of deformations: 
- a rninimum section size (see 12.9 below); 
-lirrlitation of slenderness in the case of compression members. 
(3) Any reinforcement provided in plain concrete members, although not taken into account 
for load bearing purposes, should comply with 4.4.1. 
12.9 Detailing of members and particular rules 
12.9.1 Structural members 
(1) The overall depth hw of a wall should not be smaller than 120 mm for cast in-situ concrete 
walls. 
(2) Where chases and recesses are included checks should be carried out to assure the 
adequate strength and stability of the member. 
12.9.2 Construction joints 
(1) Where tensile stresses are expected to occur in concrete, reinforcement should be detailed 
to control cracking.@l)

Indicative strength classes for durability 
E.1 General 
(1) The choice of adequately durable concrete for corrosion protection of reinforcement and 
protection of concrete attack, requires consideration of the cOrYlposition of concrete. This may 
result in a higher cOrYlpressive strength of the concrete than is required for structural design. 
The relationship between concrete strength classes and exposure classes (see Table 4.1) may 
be described by indicative strength classes. 
(2) When the chosen strength is higher than that required for structural design the value of fctm 
should be associated with the higher strength in the calculation of minimum reinforcement

Tension reinforcement expressions for in-plane stress conditions 
F.1 General 
(1) This annex does not include expressions for compression reinforcement. 
(2) The tension reinforcement in an element subject to in-plane orthogonal stresses OEdx, OEdy 
and may be calculated using the procedure set out below. Compressive stresses should 
be taken as positive, with O"Edx > OEdy, and the direction of reinforcement should coincide with 
the x and y axes. 
The tensile strengths provided by reinforcement should be determined from: 
ftdx = Px fYd and ftdy = Pi fyd (F.1 ) 
where Px and Pi are the geometric reinforcement ratios, along the x and yaxes respectively. 
(3) In locations where O"Edx and O"Edy are both compressive and O"Edx' O"EdY> IEdxy, design 
reinforcement is not required. However the nlaximum compressive stress should not exceed fed 
(See 3.1.6) 
(4) In locations where O"Edy is tensile or O"Edx ‚Ä¢ O"Edy ~ IEdxy, reinforcement is required. 
The optimum reinforcement, indicated by superscript', and related concrete stress are 
determined by: 
~~x IT Edxy I

In order to avoid unacceptable cracks for the serviceability limit state, and to ensure the 
required deformation capacity for the ultimate limit state, the reinforcement derived from 
Expressions (F.B) and (F.9) for each direction should not be more than twice and not less than 
half the reinforcement determined by expressions (F2) and (F3) or (F5) and (F6). These 
limitations are expressed by Yzftdx s,ftdx s,2ftdx and Yzftdy s,ftdy 
(5) The reinforcement should be fully anchored at all free edges, e.g. by U-bars or similar.

Soil structure interaction 
G.1 Shallow foundations 
G.1.1 General 
(1) The interaction between the ground, the foundation and the superstructure should be 
considered. The contact pressure distribution on the foundations and the column forces are 
both dependent on the relative settlements. 
(2) In general the problem may be solved by ensuring that the displacements and associated 
reactions of the soil and the structure are compatible. 
(3) Although the above general procedure is adequate, many uncertainties still exist, due to the 
load sequence and creep effects. For this reason different levels of analysis, depending on the 
degree of idealisation of the mechanical models, are usually defined. 
(4) If the superstructure is considered as flexible, then the transmitted loads do not depend on 
the relative settlements, because the structure has no rigidity. In this case the loads are no 
longer unknown, and the problem is reduced to the analysis of a foundation on a deforming 
ground. 
(5) If the superstructure is considered as rigid, then the unknown foundation loads can be 
obtained by the condition that settlements should lie on a plane. It should be checked that this 
rigidity exists until the ultimate limit state is reached. 
(6) A further simplifying scheme arises if the foundation system can be assumed to be rigid or 
the supporting ground is very stiff. In either case the relative settlements may be ignored and no 
modification of the loads transmitted fronl the superstructure is required. 
(7) To determine the approximate rigidity of the structural system, an analysis may be made 
comparing the combined stiffness of the foundation, superstructure framing menlbers and shear 
walls, with the stiffness of the ground. This relative stiffness KR will determine whether the 
foundation or the structural system should be considered rigid or flexible. The following 
expression may be used for building structures: 
KR = (EJ)s I (EI3) (G.1 ) 
where: 
(EJ)s is the approximate value of the flexural rigidity per unit width of the building 
structure under consideration, obtained by summing the flexural rigidity of the 
foundation, of each framed member and any shear wall 
E is the deformation modulus of the ground 
I is the length of the foundation 
Relative stiffnesses higher than 0,5 indicate rigid structural systems.

EN 1992-1-1:2004 (E) 
G.1.2 Levels of analysis 
(1) For design purposes, the following levels of analysis are permitted: 
Level 0: In this level, linear distribution of the contact pressure may be assumed. 
The following preconditions should be fulfilled: 
the contact pressure does not exceed the design values for both the serviceability and 
the ultimate limit states; 
at the serviceability limit state, the structural system is not affected by settlements, or the 
expected differential settlements are not significant; 
at the ultimate linlit state, the structural system has sufficient plastic deformation capacity 
so that differences in settlements do not affect the design. 
Level 1: The contact pressure may be determined taking into account the relative stiffness of 
the foundation and the soil and the resulting deformations evaluated to check that they are 
within acceptable lirrlits. 
The following preconditions should be fulfilled: 
-sufficient experience exists to show that the serviceability of the superstructure is not likely 
to be affected by the soil deformation; 
-at the ultimate limit state, the structural system has adequate ductile behaviour. 
Level 2: At this level of analysis the influence of ground deformations on the superstructure is 
considered. The structure is analysed under the imposed deformation of the foundation to 
determine the adjustments to the loads applied to the foundations. If the resulting adjustments 
are significant (i.e. > 1101 % ) then Level 3 analysis should be adopted. 
Level 3: This is a complete interactive procedure taking into account the structure, its 
foundations and the ground. 
G.2 Piled foundations 
(1) If the pile cap is rigid, a linear variation of the settlements of the individual piles may be 
assumed which depends on the rotation of the pile cap. If this rotation is zero or may be 
ignored, equal settlement of all piles may be assumed. From equilibrium equations, the 
unknown pile loads and the settlement of the group can be calculated. 
(2) However, when dealing with a piled raft, interaction occurs not only between individual piles but 
also between the raft and the piles, and no simple approach to analyse this problem is available. 
(3) The response of a pile group to horizontal loads generally involves not only the lateral 
stiffness of the surrounding soil and of the piles, but also their axial stiffness (e.g. lateral load on 
a pile group causes tension and compression on edge piles).

Global second order effects in structures 
H.1 Criteria for neglecting global second order effects 
H.1.1 General 
(1) Clause H.1 gives criteria for structures where the conditions in 5.8.3.3 (1) are not met. The 
criteria are based on 5.8.2 (6) and take into account global bending and shear deformations, as 
defined in Figure H.1. 
Figure H.1: Definition of global bending and shear deformations (11r and r respectively) 
and the corresponding stiffnesses (EI and S respectively) 
H.1.2 Bracing system without significant shear deformations 
(1) For a bracing system without significant shear deformations (e.g. shear walls without 
openings), global second order effects may be ignored if: 
FV,Ed ::; 0, 1¬∑ FV,BB 
where: 
Fv,Ed is the total vertical load (on braced and bracing n1en1bers) 
FV,BB is the nominal global buckling load for global bending, see (2) 
(2) The nominal global buckling load for global bending may be taken as 
FV,BB = ~'LEI / L 2 
where: (H.1 ) 
(H.2) 
~ is a coefficient depending on number of storeys, variation of stiffness, rigidity of base 
restraint and load distribution; see (4)

is the sum of bending stiffnesses of bracing members in direction considered, 
including possible effects of cracking; see (3) 
L is the total height of building above level of moment restraint. 
(3) In the absence of a more accurate evaluation of the stiffness, the following may be used for a 
bracing member with cracked section: 
where: 
Ecd = Ecm/rcE, design value of concrete modulus, see 5.8.6 (3) 
Ie second moment of area of bracing member 
If the cross-section is shown to be uncracked in the ultimate limit state, constant 0,4 in 
Expression (H.3) may be replaced by 0,8. 
(4) If bracing members have constant stiffness along the height and the total vertical load 
increases with the same amount per storey, then ~ may be taken as 
1 
~ 7,8¬∑ .---
ns+1,6 1+0,7¬∑k 
where: 
ns is the number of storeys 
k is the relative flexibility of moment restraint; see (5). 
(5) The relative flexibility of moment restraint at the base is defined as: 
k = (BIM)¬∑(EIIL) 
where: 
B is the rotation for bending moment M 
is the stiffness according to (3) 
L is the otal height of bracing unit (H.3) 
(H.4) 
(H.5) 
Note: For k = 0, i.e. rigid restraint, Expressions (H.1 )-(HA) can be combined into Expression (5.18), where the 
coefficient 0,31 follows from 0,1¬∑ 0,4 ¬∑7,8 z 0,31. 
H.1.3 Bracing system with significant global shear deformations 
(1) Global second order effects may be ignored if the following condition is fulfilled: 
FVEd :::;0,1¬∑FvB =0,1¬∑---'----
. , 1 + FV,BB / FV,BS (H.6) 
where 
FV,B is the global buckling load taking into account global bending and shear 
FV,BB is the global buckling load for pure bending, see H.1.2 (2) 
FV,BS is the global buckling load for pure shear, FV,BS = 2::8 
2:S is the total shear stiffness (force per shear angle) of bracing units (see Figure H.1) 
216 

=== PAGE 219 ===

BS EN 1992-1-1:2004 
EN 1992-1-1:2004 (E) 
Note: The global shear deformation of a bracing unit is normally governed mainly by local bending 
deformations (Figure H.1). Therefore, in the absence of a more refined analysis, cracking may be taken 
into account for S in the same way as for see H.1.2 (3). 
H.2 Methods for calculation of global second order effects 
(1) This clause is based on linear second order analysis according to 5.8.7. Global second 
order effects may then be taken into account by analysing the structure for fictitious, magnified 
horizontal forces FH,Ed: 
FHEd=--~-¬≠
, 1-FV,Ed / FV,B 
where: 
FH,OEd is the first order horizontal force due to wind, imperfections etc. 
FV,Ed is the total vertical load on bracing and braced members 
FV,B is the nominal global buckling load, see (2). (H.7) 
(2) The buckling load FY,B may be determined according to H .1.3 (or H .1.2 if global shear 
deformations are negligible). However, in this case nominal stiffness values according to 5.8.7.2 
should be used, including the effect of creep. 
(3) In cases where the global buckling load FV,B is not defined, the following expression may be 
used instead: 
FH,Ed =--~---1-FH.1Ed / FH,OEd 
where: (H.8) 
FH,1Ed fictitious horizontal force, giving the same bending moments as vertical load NY.Ed 
acting on the deformed structure, with deformation caused by FH,OEd (first order 
deformation), and calculated with nominal stiffness values according to 5.8.7.2 
Note: Expression (H.8) follows from a step-by-step numerical calculation, where the effect of vertical load and 
deformation increments, expressed as equivalent horizontal forces, are added in consecutive steps. The 
increments will form a geometric series after a few steps. Assuming that this occurs even at the first step, 
(which is analogous to assuming j3 =1 in 5.8.7.3 (3)), the sum can be expressed as in Expression (H.8). This 
assumption requires that the stiffness values representing the final stage of deformations are used in all steps 
(note that this is also the basic assumption behind the analysis based on nominal stiffness values). 
In other cases, e.g. if uncracked sections are assumed in the first step and cracking is found to occur in later 
steps, or if the distribution of equivalent horizontal forces changes significantly between the first steps, then 
more steps have to be included in the analysis, until the assumption of a geometric series is met. Example with 
two more steps than in Expression (H.8):

Annex I (Informative) 
Analysis of flat slabs and shear walls 
1.1 Flat Slabs 
1.1.1 General 
(1) For the purpose of this section flat slabs may be of uniform thickness or they may 
incorporate drops (thickenings over columns). 
(2) Flat slabs should be analysed using a proven method of analysis, such as grillage (in which 
the plate is idealised as a set of interconnected discrete members), finite element, yield line or 
equivalent frame. Appropriate geometric and material properties should be employed. 
1.1.2 Equivalent frame analysis 
(1) The structure should be divided longitudinally and transversely into frames consisting of 
columns and sections of slabs contained between the centre lines of adjacent panels (area 
bounded by four adjacent supports). The stiffness of members may be calculated from their 
gross cross-sections. For vertical loading the stiffness may be based on the full width of the 
panels. For horizontal loading 40% of this value should be used to reflect the increased 
flexibility of the column/slab joints in flat slab structures compared to that of colurnn/beam joints. 
Total load on the panel should be used for the analysis in each direction. 
(2) The total bending moments obtained from analysis should be distributed across the width of 
the slab. In elastic analysis negative moments tend to concentrate towards the centre lines of 
the columns. 
(3) The panels should be assumed to be divided into colurnn and middle strips (see Figure 1.1) 
and the bending moments should be apportioned as given in Table 1.1.

Note: When drops of width> (/y/3) are used the column strips may be taken to be the width of drops. The 
width of middle strips should then be adjusted accordingly. 
Table 1.1 Simplified apportionment of bending moment for a flat slab 
Negative moments Positive moments 
Column Strip 60 -80% 50 -70% 
Middle Strip 40 -20% 50 -30% 
Note: Total negative and positive moments to be resisted by the column and 
middle strips together should always add up to 100%. 
(4) Where the width of the column strip is different from 0,5/x as shown in Figure 1.1 (e.g.) and made 
equal to width of drop the width of middle strip should be adjusted accordingly. 
(5) Unless there are perimeter beams, which are adequately designed for torsion, moments 
transferred to edge or corner colurrlns should be lirrlited to the n10ment of resistance of a 
rectangular section equal to 0,17 bed2 fck (see Figure 9.9 for the definition of be). The positive 
moment in the end span should be adjusted accordingly. 
1.1.3 Irregular column layout 
(1) Where, due to the irregular layout of columns, a flat slab can not be sensibly analysed using 
the equivalent frame method, a grillage or other elastic method may be used. In such a case 
the following simplified approach will normally be sufficient: 
i) analyse the slab with the full load, roOk + rGGk, on all bays 
ii) the midspan and colurrln mon1ents should then be increased to allow for the effects of 
pattern loads. This may be achieved by loading a critical bay (or bays) with roOk + rGGk 
and the rest of the slab with rGGk. Where there may be significant variation in the 
permanent load between bays, rG should be taken as 1 for the unloaded bays. 
iii) the effects of this particular loading may then be applied to other critical bays and 
supports in a similar way. 
(2) The restrictions with regard to the transfer of moments to edge of columns given 
in ~ 1.1.2 (5) @il should be applied. 
1.2 Shear Walls 
(1) Shear walls are plain or reinforced concrete walls which contribute to the lateral stability of 
the structure. 
(2) Lateral load resisted by each shear wall in a structure should be obtained from a global 
analysis of the structure, taking into account the applied loads, the eccentricities of the loads 
with respect to the shear centre of the structure and the interaction between the different 
structural walls. 
(3) The effects of asymmetry of wind loading should be considered (see EN 1991-1-4). 
(4) The combined effects of axial loading and shear should be taken into account. 
(5) In addition to other serviceability criteria in this code, the effect of sway of shear walls on 
the occupants of the structure should also be considered, (see EN 1990). 
219

BS EN 1992-1-1:2004 
EN 1992-1-1:2004 (E) 
(6) In the case of building structures not exceeding 25 storeys, where the plan layout of the 
walls is reasonably symmetrical, and the walls do not have openings causing significant global 
shear deformations, the lateral load resisted by a shear wall may be obtained as follows: 
p = P(E1)n 
n 1:.(E1) 
where: (Pe)Yn(E1 )n 
1:.(E1 )Yn2 
Pn is the lateral load on wall n 
(EJ)n is the stiffness of wall n 
P is the applied load (1.1 ) 
e is the eccentricity of P with respect to the centroid of the stiffnesses (see Figure 
1.3) 
Yn is the distance of wall n from the centroid of stiffnesses. 
(7) If members with and without significant shear deformations are combined in the bracing 
system, the analysis should take into account both shear and flexural deformation.
